					<span>At sunset, when the rosy light was dying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far down the pathway of the west,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw a lonely dove in silence flying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">To be at rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pilgrim of air, I cried, could I but borrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy wandering wings, thy freedom blest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I'd fly away from every careful sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">And find my rest.</span>

					<span>But when the filmy veil of dusk was falling,</span>

					<span class="i1">Home flew the dove to seek his nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep in the forest where his mate was calling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">To love and rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Peace, heart of mine! no longer sigh to wander;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lose not thy life in barren quest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are no happy islands over yonder;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Come home and rest.</span>

				<span>Who watched the worn-out Winter die?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, peering through the window-pane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At nightfall, under sleet and rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the old graybeard totter by?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who listened to his parting sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sobbing of his feeble breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His whispered colloquy with Death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when his all of life was done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood near to bid a last good-bye?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all his former friends not one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the forsaken Winter die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who welcomed in the maiden Spring?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who heard her footfall, swift and light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As fairy-dancing in the night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who guessed what happy dawn would bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flutter of her bluebird's wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blossom of her mayflower-face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To brighten every shady place?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One morning, down the village street,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh, here am I,” we heard her sing,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And none had been awake to greet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coming of the maiden Spring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But look, her violet eyes are wet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With bright, unfallen, dewy tears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in her song my fancy hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A note of sorrow trembling yet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps, beyond the town, she met</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Old Winter as he limped away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To die forlorn, and let him lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His weary head upon her knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kissed his forehead with regret</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For one so gray and lonely,—see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes with tender tears are wet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so, by night, while we were all at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think the coming sped the parting guest.</span>

				<span class="i1">It seems so long ago,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day we fished together</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the Pocono?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At dusk I waited for you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the lumber-mill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there I heard a hidden bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That chanted, “whip-poor-will,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i>Whippoorwill!</i> <i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad and shrill,—“<i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The place was all deserted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mill-wheel hung at rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lonely star of evening</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was throbbing in the west;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The veil of night was falling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winds were folded still;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And everywhere the trembling air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Re-echoed “whip-poor-will!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i>Whippoorwill!</i> <i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad and shrill,—“<i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You seemed so long in coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I felt so much alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wide, dark world was round me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And life was all unknown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hand of sorrow touched me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made my senses thrill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the pain that haunts the strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of mournful whip-poor-will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i>Whippoorwill!</i> <i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad and shrill,—“<i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What knew I then of trouble?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An idle little lad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had not learned the lessons</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That make men wise and sad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dreamed of grief and parting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And something seemed to fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My heart with tears, while in my ears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resounded “whip-poor-will.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i>Whippoorwill!</i> <i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad and shrill,—“<i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>'Twas but a cloud of sadness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lightly passed away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I have learned the meaning</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sorrow, since that day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For nevermore at twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the silent mill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll wait for you, in the falling dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hear the whip-poor-will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i>Whippoorwill!</i> <i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad and shrill,—“<i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But if you still remember</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that fair land of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pains and fears that touch us</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along this edge of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think all earthly grieving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all our mortal ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To you must seem like a sad boy's dream.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hears the whip-poor-will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i>Whippoorwill!</i> <i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A passing thrill,—“<i>whippoorwill!</i>”</span>

			<p>
				<span>The moonbeams over Arno's vale in silver flood were pouring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first I heard the nightingale a long-lost love deploring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So passionate, so full of pain, it sounded strange and eerie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I longed to hear a simpler strain,—the wood-notes of the veery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The laverock sings a bonny lay above the Scottish heather;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It sprinkles down from far away like light and love together;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drops the golden notes to greet his brooding mate, his dearie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I only know one song more sweet,—the vespers of the veery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In English gardens, green and bright and full of fruity treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the blackbird with delight repeat his merry measure:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ballad was a pleasant one, the tune was loud and cheery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, with every setting sun, I listened for the veery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But far away, and far away, the tawny thrush is singing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New England woods, at close of day, with that clear chant are ringing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when my light of life is low, and heart and flesh are weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fain would hear, before I go, the wood-notes of the veery.</span>

			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Deep in the heart of the forest the lily of Yorrow is growing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blue is its cup as the sky, and with mystical odour o'erflowing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faintly it falls through the shadowy glades when the south wind is blowing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sweet are the primroses pale and the violets after a shower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet are the borders of pinks and the blossoming grapes on the bower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweeter by far is the breath of that far-away woodland flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Searching and strange in its sweetness, it steals like a perfume enchanted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the arch of the forest, and all who perceive it are haunted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeking and seeking for ever, till sight of the lily is granted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who can describe how it grows, with its chalice of lazuli leaning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over a crystalline spring, where the ferns and the mosses are greening?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who can imagine its beauty, or utter the depth of its meaning?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Calm of the journeying stars, and repose of the mountains olden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy of the swift-running rivers, and glory of sunsets golden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Secrets that cannot be told in the heart of the flower are holden.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Surely to see it is peace and the crown of a life-long endeavour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely to pluck it is gladness,—but they who have found it can never</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell of the gladness and peace: they are hid from our vision for ever.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>'Twas but a moment ago that a comrade was walking near me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning aside from the pathway he murmured a greeting to cheer me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he was lost in the shade, and I called but he did not hear me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Why should I dream he is dead, and bewail him with passionate sorrow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely I know there is gladness in finding the lily of Yorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He has discovered it first, and perhaps I shall find it to-morrow.</span>

			</header>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">The roar of the city is low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Muffled by new-fallen snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sign of the wintry moon is small and round and still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Will you come with me to-night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">To see a pleasant sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away on the river-side, at the edge of Claremont Hill?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">“And what shall we see there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">But streets that are new and bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a desolate place that the city is coming to fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">And a soldier's tomb of stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">And a few trees standing alone—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will you walk for that through the cold, to the edge of Claremont Hill?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">But there's more than that for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">In the place that I fain would see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There's a glimpse of the grace that helps us all to bear life's ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">A touch of the vital breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">That keeps the world from death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A flower that never fades, on the edge of Claremont Hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">For just where the road swings round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">In a narrow strip of ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where a group of forest trees are lingering fondly still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">There's a grave of the olden time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">When the garden bloomed in its prime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the children laughed and sang on the edge of Claremont Hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">The marble is pure and white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">And even in this dim light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You may read the simple words that are written there if you will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">You may hear a father tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Of the child he loved so well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred years ago, on the edge of Claremont Hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">The tide of the city has rolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Across that bower of old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blotted out the beds of the rose and the daffodil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">But the little playmate sleeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">And the shrine of love still keeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A record of happy days, on the edge of Claremont Hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">The river is pouring down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">To the crowded, careless town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on like a mill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">But the clamorous noise and strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Of the hurrying waves of life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flow soft by this haven of peace on the edge of Claremont Hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">And after all, my friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">When the tale of our years shall end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be it long or short, or lowly or great, as God may will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">What better praise could we hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Than this of the child so dear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You have made my life more sweet, on the edge of Claremont Hill?</span>

				<span>Only a little shrivelled seed,</span>

				<span>It might be flower, or grass, or weed;</span>

				<span>Only a box of earth on the edge</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet the reaper in the harvest, 'mid the burden and the heat,</span>

				<span>For the Over-Lord is generous, no straight walls His love confine;</span>

				<span>So to you, dear heart, I bring them: you, among the busy throng,</span>
				<span>Walk beside me, help me, cheer me, keep the days from seeming long:</span>

				<span>Saints are God's flowers, fragrant souls</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That His own hand hath planted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not in some far-off heavenly place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or solitude enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here and there and everywhere,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In lonely field, or crowded town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God sees a flower when He looks down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some wear the lily's stainless white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And some the rose of passion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some the violet's heavenly blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But each in its own fashion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With silent bloom and soft perfume,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is praising Him who from above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds each lifted face of love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One such I knew,—and had the grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thank my God for knowing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beauty of her quiet life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was like a rose in blowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fair and sweet, so all-complete</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all unconscious, as a flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That light and fragrance were her dower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No convent-garden held this rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed like secret treasure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No royal terrace guarded her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For some sole monarch's pleasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She made her shrine, this saint of mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a bright home where children played;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there she wrought and there she prayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In sunshine, when the days were glad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had the art of keeping</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clearest rays, to give again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In days of rain and weeping;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her blessed heart could still impart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some portion of its secret grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And charity shone in her face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In joy she grew from year to year;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sorrow made her sweeter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every comfort, still more kind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every loss, completer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her children came to love her name,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Christina,”—'twas a lip's caress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when they called, they seemed to bless.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No more they call, for she is gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too far away to hear them;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet they often breathe her name</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if she lingered near them;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They cannot reach her with love's speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when they say “Christina” now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">'Tis like a prayer or like a vow:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A vow to keep her life alive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In deeds of pure affection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that her love shall find in them</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A daily resurrection;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A constant prayer that they may wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some touch of that supernal light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which she blossoms in God's sight.</span>

					<span>While in thine eyes a radiant thought is born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enkindling all thy beauty like the morn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sea-like the forest rolled, in waves of green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And few the lights that glimmered, leagues between.</span>

					<span>High in the north, for fourscore years alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fair Harvard's earliest beacon-tower had shone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Yale was lighted, and an answering ray</span>

					<span>Flashed from the meadows by New Haven Bay.</span>

					<span>But deeper spread the forest, and more dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where first Neshaminy received the spark</span>

					<span>“New light!” men cried, and murmured that it came</span>

					<span>From an unsanctioned source with lawless flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It shone too free, for still the church and school</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must only shine according to their rule.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Princeton answered, in her nobler mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“God made the light, and all the light is good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no war between the old and new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The conflict lies between the false and true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stars, that high in heaven their courses run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In glory differ, but their light is one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beacons, gleaming o'er the sea of life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are rivals but in radiance, not in strife.</span>

				<p epub:type="subtitle">A Legend on a New Saying of Jesus</p>
				<p epub:type="bridgehead">In the rubbish heaps of the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus, near the River Nile, a party of English explorers, in the winter of 1897, discovered a fragment of a papyrus book, written in the second or third century, and hitherto unknown. This single leaf contained parts of seven short sentences of Christ, each introduced by the words, “Jesus says.” It is to the fifth of these Sayings of Jesus that the following poem refers.</p>

				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Hear a word that Jesus spake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Nineteen hundred years ago,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Where the crimson lilies blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Round the blue Tiberian lake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">There the bread of life He brake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Through the fields of harvest walking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">With His lowly comrades, talking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Of the secret thoughts that feed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Weary souls in time of need.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Art thou hungry? Come and take;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Hear the word that Jesus spake!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>'Tis the sacrament of labour, bread and wine divinely blest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Friendship's food and sweet refreshment, strength and courage, joy and rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">But this word the Master said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Long ago and far away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Silent and forgotten lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Buried with the silent dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Where the sands of Egypt spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Sea-like, tawny billows heaping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Over ancient cities sleeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">While the River Nile between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Rolls its summer flood of green</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Rolls its autumn flood of red:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">There the word the Master said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Written on a frail papyrus, wrinkled, scorched by fire, and torn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hidden by God's hand was waiting for its resurrection morn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Now at last the buried word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">By the delving spade is found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Sleeping in the quiet ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Now the call of life is heard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Rise again, and like a bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Fly abroad on wings of gladness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Through the darkness and the sadness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Of the toiling age, and sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Sweeter than the voice of Spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Till the hearts of men are stirred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">By the music of the word,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gospel for the heavy-laden, answer to the labourer's cry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>Raise the stone, and thou shall find me; cleave the wood and there am I.</i>”</span>

				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<span>Brother-men who look for Jesus, long to see Him close and clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearken to the tale of Felix, how he found the Master near.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Born in Egypt, 'neath the shadow of the crumbling gods of night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He forsook the ancient darkness, turned his young heart toward the Light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Seeking Christ, in vain he waited for the vision of the Lord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vainly pondered many volumes where the creeds of men were stored;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Vainly shut himself in silence, keeping vigil night and day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vainly haunted shrines and churches where the Christians came to pray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One by one he dropped the duties of the common life of care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Broke the human ties that bound him, laid his spirit waste and bare,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hoping that the Lord would enter that deserted dwelling-place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And reward the loss of all things with the vision of His face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Still the blessed vision tarried; still the light was unrevealed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still the Master, dim and distant, kept His countenance concealed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fainter grew the hope of finding, wearier grew the fruitless quest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prayer and penitence and fasting gave no comfort, brought no rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lingering in the darkened temple, ere the lamp of faith went out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felix knelt before the altar, lonely, sad, and full of doubt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Hear me, O my Lord and Master,” from the altar-step he cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let my one desire be granted, let my hope be satisfied!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Only once I long to see Thee, in the fulness of Thy grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Break the clouds that now enfold Thee, with the sunrise of Thy face!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“All that men desire and treasure have I counted loss for Thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every hope have I forsaken, save this one, my Lord to see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Loosed the sacred bands of friendship, solitary stands my heart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt be my sole companion when I see Thee as Thou art.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“From Thy distant throne in glory, flash upon my inward sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fill the midnight of my spirit with the splendour of Thy light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“All Thine other gifts and blessings, common mercies, I disown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Separated from my brothers, I would see Thy face alone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I have watched and I have waited as one waiteth for the morn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still the veil is never lifted, still Thou leavest me forlorn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now I seek Thee in the desert, where the holy hermits dwell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, beside the saint Serapion, I will find a lonely cell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“There at last Thou wilt be gracious; there Thy presence, long-concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the solitude and silence to my heart shall be revealed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou wilt come, at dawn or twilight, o'er the rolling waves of sand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall see Thee close beside me, I shall touch Thy pierced hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Lo, Thy pilgrim kneels before Thee; bless my journey with a word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me now that if I follow, I shall find Thee, O my Lord!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Felix listened: through the darkness, like a murmur of the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came a gentle sound of stillness: “Never faint, and thou shalt find.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long and toilsome was his journey through the heavy land of heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Egypt's blazing sun above him, blistering sand beneath his feet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Patiently he plodded onward, from the pathway never erred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he reached the river-headland called the Mountain of the Bird.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There the tribes of air assemble, once a year, their noisy flock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, departing, leave a sentinel perched upon the highest rock.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Far away, on joyful pinions, over land and sea they fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the watcher on the summit lonely stands against the sky.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There the eremite Serapion in a cave had made his bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the faithful bands of pilgrims sought his blessing, brought him bread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Month by month, in deep seclusion, hidden in the rocky cleft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dwelt the hermit, fasting, praying; once a year the cave he left.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On that day a happy pilgrim, chosen out of all the band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Won a special sign of favour from the holy hermit's hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Underneath the narrow window, at the doorway closely sealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the afterglow of sunset deepened round him, Felix kneeled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Man of God, of men most holy, thou whose gifts cannot be priced!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grant me thy most precious guerdon; tell me how to find the Christ.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Breathless, Felix bent and listened, but no answering voice he heard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darkness folded, dumb and deathlike, round the Mountain of the Bird.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then he said, “The saint is silent; he would teach my soul to wait:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will tarry here in patience, like a beggar at his gate.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Near the dwelling of the hermit Felix found a rude abode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a shallow tomb deserted, close beside the pilgrim-road.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So the faithful pilgrims saw him waiting there without complaint,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon they learned to call him holy, fed him as they fed the saint.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Day by day he watched the sunrise flood the distant plain with gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the River Nile beneath him, silvery coiling, sea-ward rolled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Night by night he saw the planets range their glittering court on high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw the moon, with queenly motion, mount her throne and rule the sky.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Morn advanced and midnight fled, in visionary pomp attired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never morn and never midnight brought the vision long-desired.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now at last the day is dawning when Serapion makes his gift;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felix kneels before the threshold, hardly dares his eyes to lift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now the cavern door uncloses, now the saint above him stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blesses him without a word, and leaves a token in his hands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>'Tis the guerdon of thy waiting! Look, thou happy pilgrim, look!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing but a tattered fragment of an old papyrus book.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Read! perchance the clue to guide thee hidden in the words may lie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i>Raise the stone, and thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there am I.</i>”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Can it be the mighty Master spake such simple words as these?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can it be that men must seek Him at their toil 'mid rocks and trees?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Disappointed, heavy-hearted, from the Mountain of the Bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felix mournfully descended, questioning the Master's word.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not for him a sacred dwelling, far above the haunts of men:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must turn his footsteps backward to the common life again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From a quarry near the river, hollowed out amid the hills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose the clattering voice of labour, clanking hammers, clinking drills.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dust, and noise, and hot confusion made a Babel of the spot:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, among the lowliest workers, Felix sought and found his lot.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now he swung the ponderous mallet, smote the iron in the rock—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Muscles quivering, tingling, throbbing—blow on blow and shock on shock;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now he drove the willow wedges, wet them till they swelled and split,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With their silent strength, the fragment, sent it thundering down the pit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now the groaning tackle raised it; now the rollers made it slide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Harnessed men, like beasts of burden, drew it to the river-side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now the palm-trees must be riven, massive timbers hewn and dressed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rafts to bear the stones in safety on the rushing river's breast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Axe and auger, saw and chisel, wrought the will of man in wood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>'Mid the many-handed labour Felix toiled, and found it good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Every day the blood ran fleeter through his limbs and round his heart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every night he slept the sweeter, knowing he had done his part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dreams of solitary saintship faded from him; but, instead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came a sense of daily comfort in the toil for daily bread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Far away, across the river, gleamed the white walls of the town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whither all the stones and timbers day by day were floated down.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There the workman saw his labour taking form and bearing fruit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a tree with splendid branches rising from a humble root.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Looking at the distant city, temples, houses, domes, and towers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felix cried in exultation: “All that mighty work is ours.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Every toiler in the quarry, every builder on the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every chopper in the palm-grove, every raftsman at the oar,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Hewing wood and drawing water, splitting stones and cleaving sod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the dusty ranks of labour, in the regiment of God,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“March together toward His triumph, do the task His hands prepare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Honest toil is holy service; faithful work is praise and prayer.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While he bore the heat and burden Felix felt the sense of rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flowing softly like a fountain, deep within his weary breast;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Felt the brotherhood of labour, rising round him like a tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Overflow his heart and join him to the workers at his side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Oft he cheered them with his singing at the breaking of the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told them tales of Christ at noonday, taught them words of prayer at night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Once he bent above a comrade fainting in the mid-day heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sheltered him with woven palm-leaves, gave him water, cool and sweet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then it seemed, for one swift moment, secret radiance filled the place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underneath the green palm-branches flashed a look of Jesus' face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Once again, a raftsman, slipping, plunged beneath the stream and sank;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swiftly Felix leaped to rescue, caught him, drew him toward the bank—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Battling with the cruel river, using all his strength to save—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did he dream? or was there One beside him walking on the wave?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now at last the work was ended, grove deserted, quarry stilled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felix journeyed to the city that his hands had helped to build.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In the darkness of the temple, at the closing hour of day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of old he sought the altar, as of old he knelt to pray:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Hear me, O Thou hidden Master! Thou hast sent a word to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is written—Thy commandment—I have kept it faithfully.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou hast bid me leave the visions of the solitary life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bear my part in human labour, take my share in human strife.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I have done Thy bidding, Master; raised the rock and felled the tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swung the axe and plied the hammer, working every day for Thee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Once it seemed I saw Thy presence through the bending palm-leaves gleam;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once upon the flowing water—Nay, I know not; 'twas a dream!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This I know: Thou hast been near me: more than this I dare not ask.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I see Thee not, I love Thee. Let me do Thy humblest task!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through the dimness of the temple slowly dawned a mystic light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the Master stood in glory, manifest to mortal sight:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hands that bore the mark of labour, brow that bore the print of care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hands of power, divinely tender; brow of light, divinely fair.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Hearken, good and faithful servant, true disciple, loyal friend!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast followed me and found me; I will keep thee to the end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Well I know thy toil and trouble; often weary, fainting, worn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have lived the life of labour, heavy burdens I have borne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Never in a prince's palace have I slept on golden bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never in a hermit's cavern have I eaten unearned bread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Born within a lowly stable, where the cattle round me stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trained a carpenter in Nazareth, I have toiled, and found it good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“They who tread the path of labour follow where my feet have trod;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They who work without complaining do the holy will of God.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Where the many toil together, there am I among my own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the tired workman sleepeth, there am I with him alone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I, the peace that passeth knowledge, dwell amid the daily strife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, the bread of heaven, am broken in the sacrament of life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Every task, however simple, sets the soul that does it free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every deed of love and mercy, done to man, is done to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou hast learned the open secret; thou hast come to me for rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thy burden, in thy labour, thou art Felix, doubly blest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Raise the stone, and thou shall find me; cleave the wood, and I am there.</i>”</span>

				<p>
					<span>The legend of Felix is ended, the toiling of Felix is done;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master has paid him his wages, the goal of his journey is won;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He rests, but he never is idle; a thousand years pass like a day,</span>

					<span>In the glad surprise of that Paradise where work is sweeter than play.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet often the King of that country comes out from His tireless host,</span>

					<span>And walks in this world of the weary as if He loved it the most;</span>

					<span>For here in the dusty confusion, with eyes that are heavy and dim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He meets again the labouring men who are looking and longing for Him.</span>

				<p>
					<span>He cancels the curse of Eden, and brings them a blessing instead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessed are they that labour, for Jesus partakes of their bread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He puts His hand to their burdens, He enters their homes at night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who does his best shall have as a guest the Master of life and light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And courage will come with His presence, and patience return at His touch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And manifold sins be forgiven to those who love Him much;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cries of envy and anger will change to the songs of cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The toiling age will forget its rage when the Prince of Peace draws near.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This is the gospel of labour, ring it, ye bells of the kirk!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Lord of Love came down from above, to live with the men who work.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is the rose that He planted, here in the thorn-curst soil:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heaven is blest with perfect rest, but the blessing of Earth is toil.</span>

				<p>
					<span>A silent world,—yet full of vital joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uttered in rhythmic movements manifold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sunbeams flashing on the face of things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like sudden smilings of divine delight,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A world of many sorrows too, revealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fading flowers and withering leaves and dark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tear-laden clouds, and tearless, clinging mists</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hung above the earth too sad to weep,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A world of fluent change, and changeless flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And infinite suggestion of new thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reflected in the crystal of the heart,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A world of many meanings but no words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>A silent world was Vera's home.</span>
						<span>For her</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The inner doors of sound were closely sealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The outer portals, delicate as shells</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffused with faintest rose of far-off morn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like underglow of daybreak in the sea,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ear-gates of the garden of her soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shaded by drooping tendrils of brown hair,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waited in vain for messengers to pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thread the labyrinth with flying feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swiftly knock upon the inmost door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And enter in, and speak the mystic word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through those gates no message ever came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only with eyes did she behold and see,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyes as luminous and bright and brown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As waters of a woodland river,—eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That questioned so they almost seemed to speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And answered so they almost seemed to hear,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only with wondering eyes did she behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silent splendour of a living world.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She saw the great wind ranging freely down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interminable archways of the wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While tossing boughs and bending tree-tops hailed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His coming: but no sea-toned voice of pines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No roaring of the oaks, no silvery song</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of poplars or of birches, followed him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He passed; they waved their arms and clapped their hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>There was no sound.</span>
						<span>The torrents from the hills</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaped down their rocky pathways, like wild steeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Breaking the yoke and shaking manes of foam.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lowland brooks coiled smoothly through the fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And softly spread themselves in glistening lakes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose ripples merrily danced among the reeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The standing waves that ever keep their place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the swift rapids, curled upon themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seemed about to break and never broke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the wandering waves that fill the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came buffeting in along the stony shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or plunging in along the level sands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or creeping in along the winding creeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And inlets. Yet from all the ceaseless flow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turmoil of the restless element</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came neither song of joy nor sob of grief;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there were many waters, but no voice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Silent the actors all on Nature's stage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Performed their parts before her watchful eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Coming and going, making war and love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Working and playing, all without a sound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The oxen drew their load with swaying necks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cows came sauntering home along the lane;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nodding sheep were led from field to fold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mute obedience. Down the woodland track</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hounds with panting sides and lolling tongues</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pursued their flying prey in noiseless haste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The birds, the most alive of living things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mated, and built their nests, and reared their young,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swam the flood of air like tiny ships</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rising and falling over unseen waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, gathering in great navies, bore away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To North or South, without a note of song.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All these were Vera's playmates; and she loved</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To watch them, wondering oftentimes how well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They knew their parts, and how the drama moved</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So swiftly, smoothly on from scene to scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without confusion. But she sometimes dreamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There must be something hidden in the play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unknown to her, an utterance of life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More clear than action and more deep than looks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this she felt most deeply when she watched</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her human comrades and the throngs of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who met and parted oft with moving lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had a meaning more than she could see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saw a lover bend above a maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With moving lips; and though he touched her not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sudden rose of joy bloomed in her face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saw a hater stand before his foe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And move his lips; whereat the other shrank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if he had been smitten on the mouth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saw the regiments of toiling men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marshalled in ranks and led by moving lips.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And once she saw a sight more strange than all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A crowd of people sitting charmed and still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around a little company of men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who touched their hands in measured, rhythmic time</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To curious instruments; a woman stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among them, with bright eyes and heaving breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lifted up her face and moved her lips.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Vera wondered at the idle play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when she looked around, she saw the glow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of deep delight on every face, as if</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some visitor from a celestial world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had brought glad tidings. But to her alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No angel entered, for the choir of sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was vacant in the temple of her soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worship lacked her golden crown of song.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So when by vision baffled and perplexed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saw that all the world could not be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew she could not know the whole of life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless a hidden gate should be unsealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She felt imprisoned. In her heart there grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bitter creeping plant of discontent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The plant that only grows in prison soil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose root is hunger and whose fruit is pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The springs of still delight and tranquil joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were drained as dry as desert dust to feed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never-flowering vine, whose tendrils clung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With strangling touch around the bloom of life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made it wither. Vera could not rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the limits of her silent world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along its dumb and desolate paths she roamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A captive, looking sadly for escape.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now in those distant days, and in that land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remote, there lived a Master wonderful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who knew the secret of all life, and could,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With gentle touches and with potent words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open all gates that ever had been sealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loose all prisoners whom Fate had bound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obscure he dwelt, not in the wilderness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in a hut among the throngs of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Concealed by meekness and simplicity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever as he walked the city streets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or sat in quietude beside the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or trod the hillsides and the harvest fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The multitude passed by and knew him not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there were some who knew, and turned to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For help; and unto all who asked, he gave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Vera came, and found him in the field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew him by the pity in his face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She knelt to him and held him by one hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid the other hand upon her lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mute entreaty. Then she lifted up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coils of hair that hung about her neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bared the beauty of the gates of sound,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those virgin gates through which no voice had passed,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She made them bare before the Master's sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And looked into the kindness of his face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyes that spoke of all her prisoned pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told her great desire without a word.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Master waited long in silent thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one reluctant to bestow a gift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for the sake of holding back the thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entreated, but because he surely knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of something better that he fain would give</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If only she would ask it. Then he stooped</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Vera, smiling, touched her ears and spoke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Open, fair gates, and you, reluctant doors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the ivory labyrinth of the ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let fall the bar of silence and unfold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enter, you voices of all living things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enter the garden sealed,—but softly, slowly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not with a noise confused and broken tumult,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come in an order sweet as I command you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bring the double gift of speech and hearing.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Vera began to hear. At first the wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Breathed a low prelude of the birth of sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if an organ far away were touched</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By unseen fingers; then the little stream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hurried down the hillside, swept the harp</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of music into merry, tinkling notes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the lark that poised above her head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On wings a-quiver, overflowed the air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With showers of song; and one by one the tones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all things living, in an order sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without confusion and with deepening power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entered the garden sealed. And last of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master's voice, the human voice divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passed through the gates and called her by her name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Vera heard.</span>

				<p>
					<span class="i7">What rapture of new life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must come to one for whom a silent world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is suddenly made vocal, and whose heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the same magic is awaked at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the learner's toil and long delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of a night of dumbly moving dreams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into a day that overflows with music!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This joy was Vera's; and to her it seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if a new creative morn had risen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the earth, and after the full week</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When living things unfolded silently,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after the long, quiet Sabbath day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all was still, another day had dawned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the calm expectancy of heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A secret voice had said, “Let all things speak.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world responded with an instant joy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the unseen avenues of sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were thronged with varying forms of viewless life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To every living thing a voice was given</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distinct and personal. The forest trees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were not more varied in their shades of green</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than in their tones of speech; and every bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That nested in their branches had a song</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unknown to other birds and all his own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The waters spoke a hundred dialects</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of one great language; now with pattering fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of raindrops on the glistening leaves, and now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With steady roar of rivers rushing down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To meet the sea, and now with rhythmic throb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And measured tumult of tempestuous waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now with lingering lisp of creeping tides,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The manifold discourse of many waters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But most of all the human voice was full</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of infinite variety, and ranged</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the scale of life's experience</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With changing tones, and notes both sweet and sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All fitted to express some unseen thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some vital motion of the hidden heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So Vera listened with her new-born sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To all the messengers that passed the gates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In measureless delight and utter trust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Believing that they brought a true report</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From every living thing of its true life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hoping that at last they would make clear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mystery and the meaning of the world.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But soon there came a trouble in her joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A note discordant that dissolved the chord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And broke the bliss of hearing into pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not from the harsher sounds and voices wild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of anger and of anguish, that reveal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The secret strife in nature, and confess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The touch of sorrow on the heart of life,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From these her trouble came not. For in these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>However sad, she felt the note of truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truth, though sad, is always musical.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The raging of the tempest-ridden sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The crash of thunder, and the hollow moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of winds complaining round the mountain-crags,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shrill and quavering cry of birds of prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fiercer roar of conflict-loving beasts,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these wild sounds are potent in their place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within life's mighty symphony; the charm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of truth attunes them, and the hearing ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Finds pleasure in their rude sincerity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even the broken and tumultuous noise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That rises from great cities, where the heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of human toil is beating heavily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With ceaseless murmurs of the labouring pulse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not a discord; for it speaks to life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of life unfeigned, and full of hopes and fears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And touched through all the trouble of its notes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With something real and therefore glorious.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One voice alone of all that sound on earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is hateful to the soul, and full of pain,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voice of falsehood. So when Vera heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This mocking voice, and knew that it was false;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When first she learned that human lips can speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thing that is not, and betray the ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of simple trust with treachery of words;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The joy of hearing withered in her heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For now she felt that faithless messengers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could pass the open and unguarded gates</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of sound, and bring a message all untrue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or half a truth that makes the deadliest lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or idle babble, neither false nor true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hollow to the heart, and meaningless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She heard the flattering voices of deceit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mask the hidden purposes of men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fair attire of favourable words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hide the evil in the guise of good:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voices vain and decorous and smooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fill the world with empty-hearted talk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The foolish voices, wandering and confused,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never clearly speak the thing they would,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ramble blindly round their true intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tangle sense in hopeless coils of sound,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these she heard, and with a deep mistrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began to doubt the value of her gift.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed as if the world, the living world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sincere, and vast, and real, were still concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, within the prison of her soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still waiting silently to hear the voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of perfect knowledge and of perfect peace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So with the burden of her discontent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She turned to seek the Master once again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found him sitting in the market-place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half-hidden in the shadow of a porch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Alone among the careless crowd.</span>
						<span>She spoke:</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thy gift was great, dear Master, and my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has thanked thee many times because I hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I have learned that hearing is not all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For underneath the speech of men, there flows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another current of their hidden thoughts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind the mask of language I perceive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The eyes of things unsaid.</span>
						<span>Touch me again,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Master, with thy liberating hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And free me from the bondage of deceit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open another gate, and let me hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The secret thoughts and purposes of men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For only thus my heart will be at rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And only thus, at last, I shall perceive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mystery and the meaning of the world.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Master's face was turned aside from her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyes looked far away, as if he saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something beyond her sight; and yet she knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was listening; for her pleading voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner ceased than he put forth his hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To touch her brow, and very gently spoke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou seekest for thyself a wondrous gift,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The opening of the second gate, a gift</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That many wise men have desired in vain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But some have found it,—whether well or ill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their own peace, they have attained the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hear unspoken thoughts of other men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou hast begged this gift? Thou shalt receive,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not knowing what thou seekest,—it is thine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second gate is open! Thou shalt hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that men think and feel within their hearts:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy prayer is granted, daughter, go thy way!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if thou findest sorrow on this path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come back again,—there is a path to peace.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>Beyond our power of vision, poets say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is another world of forms unseen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet visible to purer eyes than ours.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the crystal of our sight were clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We should behold the mountain-slopes of cloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moving meadows of the untilled sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The groves of twilight and the dales of dawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every wide and lonely field of air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More populous than cities, crowded close</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With living creatures of all shapes and hues.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if that sight were ours, the things that now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Engage our eyes would seem but dull and dim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside the wonders of our new-found world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we should be amazed and overwhelmed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not knowing how to use the plenitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Of vision.</span>
						<span>So in Vera's soul, at first,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The opening of the second gate of sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let in confusion like a whirling flood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The murmur of a myriad-throated mob;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trampling of an army through a place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where echoes hide; the sudden, whistling flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of an innumerable flock of birds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the highway of the midnight sky;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The many-whispered rustling of the reeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the passing feet of all the winds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long-drawn, inarticulate, wailing cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of million-pebbled beaches when the lash</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of stormy waves is drawn across their back,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these were less bewildering than to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What now she heard at once: the tangled sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all that moves within the minds of men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For now there was no measured flow of words</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mark the time; nor any interval</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silence to repose the listening ear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through the dead of night, and through the calm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of weary noon-tide, through the solemn hush</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fills the temple in the pause of praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the breathless awe in rooms of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She heard the ceaseless motion and the stir</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of never-silent hearts, that fill the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With interwoven thoughts of good and ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mingled music of delight and grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With songs of love, and bitter cries of hate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With hymns of faith, and dirges of despair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And murmurs deeper and more vague than all,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thoughts that are born and die without a name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or rather, never die, but haunt the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sad persistence, till a name is given.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These Vera heard, at first with mind perplexed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And half-benumbed by the disordered sound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon a clearer sense began to pierce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cloudy turmoil with discerning power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She learned to know the tones of human thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As plainly as she knew the tones of speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She could divide the evil from the good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interpreting the language of the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tracing every feeling like a thread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the mystic web the passions weave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From heart to heart around the living world.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when at last the Master's second gift</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was perfected within her, and she heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And understood the secret thoughts of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sadness fell upon her, and the load</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of insupportable knowledge pressed her down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With weary wishes to know more, or less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all she knew was like a broken word</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inscribed upon the fragment of a ring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all she heard was like a broken strain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preluding music that is never played.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then she remembered in her sad unrest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master's parting word,—“a path to peace,”—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turned again to seek him with her grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She found him in a hollow of the hills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside a little spring that issued forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the rocks and filled a mossy cup</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With never-failing water. There he sat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With waiting looks that welcomed her afar.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I know that thou hast heard, my child,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For all the wonder of the world of sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is written in thy face. But hast thou heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the many voices, one of peace?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is thy heart that hears the secret thoughts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hidden wishes and desires of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Content with hearing? Art thou satisfied?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, Master,” she replied, “thou knowest well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I am not at rest, nor have I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voice of perfect peace; but what I hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brings me disquiet and a troubled mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The evil voices in the souls of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Voices of rage and cruelty and fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have not dismayed me; for I have believed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voices of the good, the kind, the true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are more in number and excel in strength.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is more love than hate, more hope than fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the deep throbbing of the human heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But while I listen to the troubled sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One thing torments me, and destroys my rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And presses me with dull, unceasing pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For out of all the minds of all mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There rises evermore a questioning voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That asks the meaning of this mighty world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finds no answer,—asks, and asks again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With patient pleading or with wild complaint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wakens no response, except the sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of other questions, wandering to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From other souls in doubt. And so this voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Persists above all others that I hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And binds them up together into one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the mingled murmur of the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sounds through the inner temple of my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like an eternal question, vainly asked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By every human soul that thinks and feels.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is the heaviness that weighs me down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this the pain that will not let me rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, dear Master, shut the gates again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let me live in silence as before!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else,—and if there is indeed a gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unopened yet, through which I might receive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An answer in the voice of perfect peace—”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She ceased; and in her upward faltering tone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The question echoed.</span>
						<span>Then the Master said:</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“There is another gate, not yet unclosed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For through the outer portal of the ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only the outer voice of things may pass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the middle doorway of the mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only the half-formed voice of human thoughts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uncertain and perplexed with endless doubt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through the inmost gate the spirit hears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voice of that great Spirit who is Life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the tones of living things He breathes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A deeper tone than ever ear hath heard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And underneath the troubled thoughts of men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thinks forever, and His thought is peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold, I touch thee once again, my child:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The third and last of those three hidden gates</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That closed around thy soul and shut thee in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is open now, and thou shalt truly hear.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Vera heard. The spiritual gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was opened softly as a full-blown flower</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unfolds its heart to welcome in the dawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on her listening face there shone a light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of still amazement and completed joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>In the full gift of hearing.</span>
						<span>What she heard</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot tell; nor could she ever tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In words; because all human words are vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no speech nor language, to express</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The secret messages of God, that make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perpetual music in the hearing heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below the voice of waters, and above</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wandering voice of winds, and underneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The song of birds, and all the varying tones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of living things that fill the world with sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God spoke to her, and what she heard was peace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So when the Master questioned, “Dost thou hear?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She answered, “Yea, at last I hear.” And then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He asked her once again, “What hearest thou?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What means the voice of Life?” She answered, “Love!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For love is life, and they who do not love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are not alive. But every soul that loves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lives in the heart of God and hears Him speak.”</span>

				<h2 epub:type="title">Another Chance</h2>
				<p epub:type="subtitle">A Dramatic Lyric</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Come, give me back my life again, you heavy-handed Death!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uncrook your fingers from my throat, and let me draw my breath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You do me wrong to take me now—too soon for me to die—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, loose me from this clutching pain, and hear the reason why.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I know I've had my forty years, and wasted every one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, I tell you honestly, my life is just begun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I've walked the world like one asleep, a dreamer in a trance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now you've gripped me wide awake—I want another chance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My dreams were always beautiful, my thoughts were high and fine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No life was ever lived on earth to match those dreams of mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would you wreck them unfulfilled? What folly, nay, what crime!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You rob the world, you waste a soul; give me a little time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You'll hear me? Yes, I'm sure you will, my hope is not in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I feel the even pulse of peace, the sweet relief from pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The black fog rolls away from me; I'm free once more to plan:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another chance is all I need to prove myself a man!</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>The world is full of warfare 'twixt the evil and the good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I watched the battle from afar as one who understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shouting and confusion, the bloody, blundering fight—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How few there are that see it clear, how few that wage it right!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The captains flushed with foolish pride, the soldiers pale with fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faltering flags, the feeble fire from ranks that swerve and veer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wild mistakes, the dismal doubts, the coward hearts that flee—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The good cause needs a nobler knight to win the victory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A man whose soul is pure and strong, whose sword is bright and keen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows the splendour of the fight and what its issues mean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who never takes one step aside, nor halts, though hope be dim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But cleaves a pathway thro' the strife, and bids men follow him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No blot upon his stainless shield, no weakness in his arm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sign of trembling in his face to break his valour's charm:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man like this could stay the flight and lead the wavering line;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, give me but a year of life—I'll make that glory mine!</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>Religion? Yes, I know it well; I've heard its prayers and creeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seen men put them all to shame with poor, half-hearted deeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They follow Christ, but far away; they wander and they doubt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll serve him in a better way, and live his precepts out.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You see, I waited just for this; I could not be content</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To own a feeble, faltering faith with human weakness blent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too many runners in the race move slowly, stumble, fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I will run so straight and swift I shall outstrip them all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, think what it will mean to men, amid their foolish strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see the clear, unshadowed light of one true Christian life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without a touch of selfishness, without a taint of sin,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one short month of such a life a new world would begin!</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>And love!—I often dream of that—the treasure of the earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How little they who use the coin have realised its worth!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twill pay all debts, enrich all hearts, and make all joys secure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But love, to do its perfect work, must be sincere and pure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My heart is full of virgin gold. I'll pour it out and spend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My hidden wealth with open hand on all who call me friend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one shall miss the kindly deed, the largess of relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The generous fellowship of joy, the sympathy of grief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I'll say the loyal, helpful things that make life sweet and fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll pay the gratitude I owe for human love and care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps I've been at fault sometimes—I'll ask to be forgiven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make this little room of mine seem like a bit of heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For one by one I'll call my friends to stand beside my bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll speak the true and tender words so often left unsaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every heart shall throb and glow, all coldness melt away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around my altar-fire of love—ah, give me but one day!</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>What's that? I've had another day, and wasted it again?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A priceless day in empty dreams, another chance in vain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou fool—this night—it's very dark—the last—this choking breath—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One prayer—have mercy on a dreamer's soul—God, this is death!</span>
