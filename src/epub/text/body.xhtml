THE AFTER-ECHO</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How long the echoes love to play</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Around the shore of silence, as a wave</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Retreating circles down the sand!</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  One after one, with sweet delay,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The mellow sounds that cliff and island gave,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Have lingered in the crescent bay,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Until, by lightest breezes fanned,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They float far off beyond the dying day</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      And leave it still as death.</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        But hark,—</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Another singing breath</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Comes from the edge of dark;</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      A note as clear and slow</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    As falls from some enchanted bell,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Or spirit, passing from the world below,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      That whispers back, Farewell.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i3">      So in the heart,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    When, fading slowly down the past,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Fond memories depart,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And each that leaves it seems the last;</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Long after all the rest are flown,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Returns a solitary tone,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The after-echo of departed years,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And touches all the soul to tears.</span></p>

DULCIORA</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A tear that trembles for a little while</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Upon the trembling eyelid, till the world</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Wavers within its circle like a dream,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Holds more of meaning in its narrow orb</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Than all the distant landscape that it blurs.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A smile that hovers round a mouth beloved,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like the faint pulsing of the Northern Light,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And grows in silence to an amber dawn</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Born in the sweetest depths of trustful eyes,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is dearer to the soul than sun or star.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A joy that falls into the hollow heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From some far-lifted height of love unseen,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unknown, makes a more perfect melody</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Than hidden brooks that murmur in the dusk,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or fall athwart the cliff with wavering gleam.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, not for their own sake are earth and sky</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the fair ministries of Nature dear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But as they set themselves unto the tune</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That fills our life; as light mysterious</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Flows from within and glorifies the world.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="5" id="page5"/>
<span class="i0">For so a common wayside blossom, touched</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With tender thought, assumes a grace more sweet</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Than crowns the royal lily of the South;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And so a well-remembered perfume seems</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The breath of one who breathes in Paradise.</span></p>

THREE ALPINE SONNETS</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<h4>THE GLACIER</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dawn in silence moves the mighty stream,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The silver-crested waves no murmur make;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  But far away the avalanches wake</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The rumbling echoes, dull as in a dream;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Their momentary thunders, dying, seem</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To fall into the stillness, flake by flake,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And leave the hollow air with naught to break</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The frozen spell of solitude supreme.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At noon unnumbered rills begin to spring</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Beneath the burning sun, and all the walls</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of all the ocean-blue crevasses ring</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With liquid lyrics of their waterfalls;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As if a poet's heart had felt the glow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of sovereign love, and song began to flow.</span></p>
<p class="note">Zermatt, 1872.</p>
<h4><a class="pagebreak" title="7" id="page7"/>
II</h4>
<h4>THE SNOW-FIELD</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">White Death had laid his pall upon the plain,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And crowned the mountain-peaks like monarchs dead;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The vault of heaven was glaring overhead</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With pitiless light that filled my eyes with pain;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And while I vainly longed, and looked in vain</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  For sign or trace of life, my spirit said,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  “Shall any living thing that dares to tread</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This royal lair of Death escape again?”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But even then I saw before my feet</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  A line of pointed footprints in the snow:</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Some roving chamois, but an hour ago,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Had passed this way along his journey fleet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And left a message from a friend unknown</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To cheer my pilgrim-heart, no more alone.</span></p>
<p class="note">Zermatt, 1872.</p>
<h4><a class="pagebreak" title="8" id="page8"/>
III</h4>
<h4>MOVING BELLS</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I love the hour that comes, with dusky hair</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And dewy feet, along the Alpine dells,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To lead the cattle forth. A thousand bells</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Go chiming after her across the fair</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And flowery uplands, while the rosy flare</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of sunset on the snowy mountain dwells,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And valleys darken, and the drowsy spells</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of peace are woven through the purple air.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear is the magic of this hour: she seems</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To walk before the dark by falling rills,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And lend a sweeter song to hidden streams;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  She opens all the doors of night, and fills</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With moving bells the music of my dreams,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  That wander far among the sleeping hills.</span></p>
<p class="note">Gstaad, August, 1909.</p>
<h3><a class="pagebreak" title="9" id="page9"/>
MATINS</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flowers rejoice when night is done,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lift their heads to greet the sun;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sweetest looks and odours raise,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In a silent hymn of praise.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So my heart would turn away</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From the darkness to the day;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lying open in God's sight</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like a flower in the light.</span></p>
<h3><a class="pagebreak" title="10" id="page10"/>
THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who watched the worn-out Winter die?</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Who, peering through the window-pane</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  At nightfall, under sleet and rain</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Saw the old graybeard totter by?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who listened to his parting sigh,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The sobbing of his feeble breath,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  His whispered colloquy with Death,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And when his all of life was done</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Stood near to bid a last good-bye?</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of all his former friends not one</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Saw the forsaken Winter die.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who welcomed in the maiden Spring?</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Who heard her footfall, swift and light</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  As fairy-dancing in the night?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who guessed what happy dawn would bring</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The flutter of her bluebird's wing,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The blossom of her mayflower-face</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To brighten every shady place?</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  One morning, down the village street,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Oh, here am I,” we heard her sing,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And none had been awake to greet</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The coming of the maiden Spring.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="11" id="page11"/>
<span class="i0">But look, her violet eyes are wet</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With bright, unfallen, dewy tears;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And in her song my fancy hears</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A note of sorrow trembling yet.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, beyond the town, she met</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Old Winter as he limped away</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To die forlorn, and let him lay</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  His weary head upon her knee,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And kissed his forehead with regret</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  For one so gray and lonely,—see,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Her eyes with tender tears are wet.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so, by night, while we were all at rest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I think the coming sped the parting guest.</span></p>
<p class="note">1873.</p>

IF ALL THE SKIES</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If all the skies were sunshine,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Our faces would be fain</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To feel once more upon them</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The cooling plash of rain.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If all the world were music,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Our hearts would often long</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For one sweet strain of silence.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To break the endless song.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If life were always merry,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Our souls would seek relief,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And rest from weary laughter</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In the quiet arms of grief.</span></p>
<h3><a class="pagebreak" title="13" id="page13"/>
WINGS OF A DOVE</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At sunset, when the rosy light was dying</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Far down the pathway of the west,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I saw a lonely dove in silence flying,</span><br/>
<span class="i6">            To be at rest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pilgrim of air, I cried, could I but borrow</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Thy wandering wings, thy freedom blest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I'd fly away from every careful sorrow,</span><br/>
<span class="i6">            And find my rest.</span></p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when the filmy veil of dusk was falling,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Home flew the dove to seek his nest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Deep in the forest where his mate was calling</span><br/>
<span class="i6">            To love and rest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace, heart of mine! no longer sigh to wander;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Lose not thy life in barren quest.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There are no happy islands over yonder;</span><br/>
<span class="i6">            Come home and rest.</span></p>

THE FALL OF THE LEAVES</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In warlike pomp, with banners flowing,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The regiments of autumn stood:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I saw their gold and scarlet glowing</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  From every hillside, every wood.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Above the sea the clouds were keeping</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Their secret leaguer, gray and still;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They sent their misty vanguard creeping</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With muffled step from hill to hill.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All day the sullen armies drifted</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Athwart the sky with slanting rain;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">At sunset for a space they lifted,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With dusk they settled down again.</span></p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dark the winds began to blow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With mutterings distant, low;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  From sea and sky they called their strength</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Till with an angry, broken roar,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Like billows on an unseen shore,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Their fury burst at length.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="15" id="page15"/>
<span class="i0">I heard through the night</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The rush and the clamour;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The pulse of the fight</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Like blows of Thor's hammer;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The pattering flight</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of the leaves, and the anguished</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Moan of the forest vanquished.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At daybreak came a gusty song:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Shout! the winds are strong.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The little people of the leaves are fled.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Shout! The Autumn is dead!”</span></p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The storm is ended! The impartial sun</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Laughs down upon the battle lost and won,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And crowns the triumph of the cloudy host</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In rolling lines retreating to the coast.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But we, fond lovers of the woodland shade,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And grateful friends of every fallen leaf,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Forget the glories of the cloud-parade,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And walk the ruined woods in quiet grief.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For ever so our thoughtful hearts repeat</span><br/>
<span class="i0">On fields of triumph dirges of defeat;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And still we turn on gala-days to tread</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Among the rustling memories of the dead.</span></p>

A SNOW-SONG</h3>

THE TOILING OF FELIX<br/><br/>
A LEGEND ON A NEW SAYING OF JESUS</h2>
<p class="note">
<a class="pagebreak" title="82" id="page82"/>
In the rubbish heaps of the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus, near the
River Nile, a party of English explorers, in the winter of 1897, discovered
a fragment of a papyrus book, written in the second or third century,
and hitherto unknown. This single leaf contained parts of seven short
sentences of Christ, each introduced by the words, “Jesus says.” It
is to the fifth of these Sayings of Jesus that the following poem refers.
</p>
<h3><a class="pagebreak" title="83" id="page83"/>
THE TOILING OF FELIX</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<h4>PRELUDE</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i3">      Hear a word that Jesus spake</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Nineteen hundred years ago,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Where the crimson lilies blow</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Round the blue Tiberian lake:</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      There the bread of life He brake,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Through the fields of harvest walking</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        With His lowly comrades, talking</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Of the secret thoughts that feed</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Weary souls in time of need.</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Art thou hungry? Come and take;</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Hear the word that Jesus spake!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">'Tis the sacrament of labour, bread and wine divinely blest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Friendship's food and sweet refreshment, strength and courage, joy and rest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i3">      But this word the Master said</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Long ago and far away,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Silent and forgotten lay</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Buried with the silent dead,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Where the sands of Egypt spread</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Sea-like, tawny billows heaping</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Over ancient cities sleeping,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="84" id="page84"/>
<span class="i4">        While the River Nile between</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Rolls its summer flood of green</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Rolls its autumn flood of red:</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      There the word the Master said,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Written on a frail papyrus, wrinkled, scorched by fire, and torn,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Hidden by God's hand was waiting for its resurrection morn.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i3">      Now at last the buried word</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        By the delving spade is found,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Sleeping in the quiet ground.</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Now the call of life is heard:</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Rise again, and like a bird,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Fly abroad on wings of gladness</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Through the darkness and the sadness,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Of the toiling age, and sing</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Sweeter than the voice of Spring,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Till the hearts of men are stirred</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      By the music of the word,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Gospel for the heavy-laden, answer to the labourer's cry:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“<i>Raise the stone, and thou shall find me; cleave the wood and there am I.</i>”</span></p>

<h4>LEGEND</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Brother-men who look for Jesus, long to see Him close and clear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Hearken to the tale of Felix, how he found the Master near.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Born in Egypt, 'neath the shadow of the crumbling gods of night,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He forsook the ancient darkness, turned his young heart toward the Light.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Seeking Christ, in vain he waited for the vision of the Lord;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Vainly pondered many volumes where the creeds of men were stored;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vainly shut himself in silence, keeping vigil night and day;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Vainly haunted shrines and churches where the Christians came to pray.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One by one he dropped the duties of the common life of care,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Broke the human ties that bound him, laid his spirit waste and bare,</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="86" id="page86"/>
<span class="i0">Hoping that the Lord would enter that deserted dwelling-place,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And reward the loss of all things with the vision of His face.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the blessed vision tarried; still the light was unrevealed;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Still the Master, dim and distant, kept His countenance concealed.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fainter grew the hope of finding, wearier grew the fruitless quest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Prayer and penitence and fasting gave no comfort, brought no rest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lingering in the darkened temple, ere the lamp of faith went out,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Felix knelt before the altar, lonely, sad, and full of doubt.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hear me, O my Lord and Master,” from the altar-step he cried,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Let my one desire be granted, let my hope be satisfied!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Only once I long to see Thee, in the fulness of Thy grace:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Break the clouds that now enfold Thee, with the sunrise of Thy face!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="87" id="page87"/>
<span class="i0">“All that men desire and treasure have I counted loss for Thee;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Every hope have I forsaken, save this one, my Lord to see.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Loosed the sacred bands of friendship, solitary stands my heart;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt be my sole companion when I see Thee as Thou art.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“From Thy distant throne in glory, flash upon my inward sight,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Fill the midnight of my spirit with the splendour of Thy light.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All Thine other gifts and blessings, common mercies, I disown;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Separated from my brothers, I would see Thy face alone.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I have watched and I have waited as one waiteth for the morn:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Still the veil is never lifted, still Thou leavest me forlorn.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now I seek Thee in the desert, where the holy hermits dwell;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There, beside the saint Serapion, I will find a lonely cell.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="88" id="page88"/>
<span class="i0">“There at last Thou wilt be gracious; there Thy presence, long-concealed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the solitude and silence to my heart shall be revealed.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thou wilt come, at dawn or twilight, o'er the rolling waves of sand;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I shall see Thee close beside me, I shall touch Thy pierced hand.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Lo, Thy pilgrim kneels before Thee; bless my journey with a word;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Tell me now that if I follow, I shall find Thee, O my Lord!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Felix listened: through the darkness, like a murmur of the wind,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Came a gentle sound of stillness: “Never faint, and thou shalt find.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long and toilsome was his journey through the heavy land of heat,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Egypt's blazing sun above him, blistering sand beneath his feet.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Patiently he plodded onward, from the pathway never erred,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Till he reached the river-headland called the Mountain of the Bird.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="89" id="page89"/>
<span class="i0">There the tribes of air assemble, once a year, their noisy flock,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then, departing, leave a sentinel perched upon the highest rock.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far away, on joyful pinions, over land and sea they fly;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But the watcher on the summit lonely stands against the sky.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There the eremite Serapion in a cave had made his bed;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There the faithful bands of pilgrims sought his blessing, brought him bread.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Month by month, in deep seclusion, hidden in the rocky cleft,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Dwelt the hermit, fasting, praying; once a year the cave he left.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On that day a happy pilgrim, chosen out of all the band,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Won a special sign of favour from the holy hermit's hand.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Underneath the narrow window, at the doorway closely sealed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While the afterglow of sunset deepened round him, Felix kneeled.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="90" id="page90"/>
<span class="i0">“Man of God, of men most holy, thou whose gifts cannot be priced!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Grant me thy most precious guerdon; tell me how to find the Christ.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Breathless, Felix bent and listened, but no answering voice he heard;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Darkness folded, dumb and deathlike, round the Mountain of the Bird.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he said, “The saint is silent; he would teach my soul to wait:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I will tarry here in patience, like a beggar at his gate.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Near the dwelling of the hermit Felix found a rude abode,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In a shallow tomb deserted, close beside the pilgrim-road.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the faithful pilgrims saw him waiting there without complaint,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Soon they learned to call him holy, fed him as they fed the saint.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Day by day he watched the sunrise flood the distant plain with gold,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While the River Nile beneath him, silvery coiling, sea-ward rolled.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="91" id="page91"/>
<span class="i0">Night by night he saw the planets range their glittering court on high,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Saw the moon, with queenly motion, mount her throne and rule the sky.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Morn advanced and midnight fled, in visionary pomp attired;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Never morn and never midnight brought the vision long-desired.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now at last the day is dawning when Serapion makes his gift;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Felix kneels before the threshold, hardly dares his eyes to lift.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the cavern door uncloses, now the saint above him stands,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Blesses him without a word, and leaves a token in his hands.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis the guerdon of thy waiting! Look, thou happy pilgrim, look!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Nothing but a tattered fragment of an old papyrus book.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Read! perchance the clue to guide thee hidden in the words may lie:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“<i>Raise the stone, and thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there am I.</i>”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="92" id="page92"/>
<span class="i0">Can it be the mighty Master spake such simple words as these?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Can it be that men must seek Him at their toil 'mid rocks and trees?</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Disappointed, heavy-hearted, from the Mountain of the Bird</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Felix mournfully descended, questioning the Master's word.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not for him a sacred dwelling, far above the haunts of men:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He must turn his footsteps backward to the common life again.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From a quarry near the river, hollowed out amid the hills,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Rose the clattering voice of labour, clanking hammers, clinking drills.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dust, and noise, and hot confusion made a Babel of the spot:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There, among the lowliest workers, Felix sought and found his lot.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now he swung the ponderous mallet, smote the iron in the rock—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Muscles quivering, tingling, throbbing—blow on blow and shock on shock;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="93" id="page93"/>
<span class="i0">Now he drove the willow wedges, wet them till they swelled and split,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With their silent strength, the fragment, sent it thundering down the pit.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the groaning tackle raised it; now the rollers made it slide;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Harnessed men, like beasts of burden, drew it to the river-side.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the palm-trees must be riven, massive timbers hewn and dressed;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Rafts to bear the stones in safety on the rushing river's breast.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Axe and auger, saw and chisel, wrought the will of man in wood:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">'Mid the many-handed labour Felix toiled, and found it good.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Every day the blood ran fleeter through his limbs and round his heart;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Every night he slept the sweeter, knowing he had done his part.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dreams of solitary saintship faded from him; but, instead,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Came a sense of daily comfort in the toil for daily bread.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="94" id="page94"/>
<span class="i0">Far away, across the river, gleamed the white walls of the town</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Whither all the stones and timbers day by day were floated down.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There the workman saw his labour taking form and bearing fruit,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like a tree with splendid branches rising from a humble root.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Looking at the distant city, temples, houses, domes, and towers,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Felix cried in exultation: “All that mighty work is ours.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Every toiler in the quarry, every builder on the shore,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Every chopper in the palm-grove, every raftsman at the oar,</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hewing wood and drawing water, splitting stones and cleaving sod,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All the dusty ranks of labour, in the regiment of God,</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“March together toward His triumph, do the task His hands prepare:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Honest toil is holy service; faithful work is praise and prayer.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">

<span class="i0">While he bore the heat and burden Felix felt the sense of rest</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Flowing softly like a fountain, deep within his weary breast;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Felt the brotherhood of labour, rising round him like a tide,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Overflow his heart and join him to the workers at his side.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oft he cheered them with his singing at the breaking of the light,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Told them tales of Christ at noonday, taught them words of prayer at night.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once he bent above a comrade fainting in the mid-day heat,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sheltered him with woven palm-leaves, gave him water, cool and sweet.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then it seemed, for one swift moment, secret radiance filled the place;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Underneath the green palm-branches flashed a look of Jesus' face.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once again, a raftsman, slipping, plunged beneath the stream and sank;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Swiftly Felix leaped to rescue, caught him, drew him toward the bank—</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="96" id="page96"/>
<span class="i0">Battling with the cruel river, using all his strength to save—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Did he dream? or was there One beside him walking on the wave?</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now at last the work was ended, grove deserted, quarry stilled;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Felix journeyed to the city that his hands had helped to build.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the darkness of the temple, at the closing hour of day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As of old he sought the altar, as of old he knelt to pray:</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hear me, O Thou hidden Master! Thou hast sent a word to me;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It is written—Thy commandment—I have kept it faithfully.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thou hast bid me leave the visions of the solitary life,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Bear my part in human labour, take my share in human strife.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I have done Thy bidding, Master; raised the rock and felled the tree,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Swung the axe and plied the hammer, working every day for Thee.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="97" id="page97"/>
<span class="i0">“Once it seemed I saw Thy presence through the bending palm-leaves gleam;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Once upon the flowing water—Nay, I know not; 'twas a dream!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“This I know: Thou hast been near me: more than this I dare not ask.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Though I see Thee not, I love Thee. Let me do Thy humblest task!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the dimness of the temple slowly dawned a mystic light;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There the Master stood in glory, manifest to mortal sight:</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hands that bore the mark of labour, brow that bore the print of care;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Hands of power, divinely tender; brow of light, divinely fair.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hearken, good and faithful servant, true disciple, loyal friend!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thou hast followed me and found me; I will keep thee to the end.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Well I know thy toil and trouble; often weary, fainting, worn,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I have lived the life of labour, heavy burdens I have borne.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="98" id="page98"/>
<span class="i0">“Never in a prince's palace have I slept on golden bed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Never in a hermit's cavern have I eaten unearned bread.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Born within a lowly stable, where the cattle round me stood,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Trained a carpenter in Nazareth, I have toiled, and found it good.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They who tread the path of labour follow where my feet have trod;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They who work without complaining do the holy will of God.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Where the many toil together, there am I among my own;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where the tired workman sleepeth, there am I with him alone.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I, the peace that passeth knowledge, dwell amid the daily strife;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I, the bread of heaven, am broken in the sacrament of life.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Every task, however simple, sets the soul that does it free;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Every deed of love and mercy, done to man, is done to me.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="99" id="page99"/>
<span class="i0">“Thou hast learned the open secret; thou hast come to me for rest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With thy burden, in thy labour, thou art Felix, doubly blest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere;</span><br/>
<span class="i0"><i>Raise the stone, and thou shall find me; cleave the wood, and I am there.</i>”</span></p>

<h4>ENVOY</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The legend of Felix is ended, the toiling of Felix is done;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Master has paid him his wages, the goal of his journey is won;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He rests, but he never is idle; a thousand years pass like a day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the glad surprise of that Paradise where work is sweeter than play.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet often the King of that country comes out from His tireless host,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And walks in this world of the weary as if He loved it the most;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For here in the dusty confusion, with eyes that are heavy and dim,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He meets again the labouring men who are looking and longing for Him.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="100" id="page100"/>
<span class="i0">He cancels the curse of Eden, and brings them a blessing instead:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Blessed are they that labour, for Jesus partakes of their bread.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He puts His hand to their burdens, He enters their homes at night:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who does his best shall have as a guest the Master of life and light.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And courage will come with His presence, and patience return at His touch,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And manifold sins be forgiven to those who love Him much;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The cries of envy and anger will change to the songs of cheer,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The toiling age will forget its rage when the Prince of Peace draws near.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is the gospel of labour, ring it, ye bells of the kirk!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Lord of Love came down from above, to live with the men who work.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This is the rose that He planted, here in the thorn-curst soil:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Heaven is blest with perfect rest, but the blessing of Earth is toil.</span></p>

VERA</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A silent world,—yet full of vital joy</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Uttered in rhythmic movements manifold,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And sunbeams flashing on the face of things</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like sudden smilings of divine delight,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A world of many sorrows too, revealed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In fading flowers and withering leaves and dark</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Tear-laden clouds, and tearless, clinging mists</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That hung above the earth too sad to weep,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A world of fluent change, and changeless flow,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And infinite suggestion of new thought,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Reflected in the crystal of the heart,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A world of many meanings but no words,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A silent world was Vera's home.</span><br/>
<span class="i16">                                For her</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The inner doors of sound were closely sealed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The outer portals, delicate as shells</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Suffused with faintest rose of far-off morn,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like underglow of daybreak in the sea,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The ear-gates of the garden of her soul,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Shaded by drooping tendrils of brown hair,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Waited in vain for messengers to pass,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And thread the labyrinth with flying feet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And swiftly knock upon the inmost door,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And enter in, and speak the mystic word.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="102" id="page102"/>
<span class="i0">But through those gates no message ever came.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Only with eyes did she behold and see,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With eyes as luminous and bright and brown</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As waters of a woodland river,—eyes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That questioned so they almost seemed to speak,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And answered so they almost seemed to hear,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Only with wondering eyes did she behold</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The silent splendour of a living world.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She saw the great wind ranging freely down</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Interminable archways of the wood,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While tossing boughs and bending tree-tops hailed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His coming: but no sea-toned voice of pines,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">No roaring of the oaks, no silvery song</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of poplars or of birches, followed him.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He passed; they waved their arms and clapped their hands;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There was no sound.</span><br/>
<span class="i10">                    The torrents from the hills</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Leaped down their rocky pathways, like wild steeds</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Breaking the yoke and shaking manes of foam.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The lowland brooks coiled smoothly through the fields,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And softly spread themselves in glistening lakes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Whose ripples merrily danced among the reeds.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The standing waves that ever keep their place</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the swift rapids, curled upon themselves,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And seemed about to break and never broke;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all the wandering waves that fill the sea</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="103" id="page103"/>
<span class="i0">Came buffeting in along the stony shore,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or plunging in along the level sands,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or creeping in along the winding creeks</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And inlets. Yet from all the ceaseless flow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And turmoil of the restless element</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Came neither song of joy nor sob of grief;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For there were many waters, but no voice.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Silent the actors all on Nature's stage</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Performed their parts before her watchful eyes,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Coming and going, making war and love,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Working and playing, all without a sound.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The oxen drew their load with swaying necks;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The cows came sauntering home along the lane;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The nodding sheep were led from field to fold</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In mute obedience. Down the woodland track</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The hounds with panting sides and lolling tongues</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Pursued their flying prey in noiseless haste.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The birds, the most alive of living things,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Mated, and built their nests, and reared their young,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And swam the flood of air like tiny ships</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Rising and falling over unseen waves,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And, gathering in great navies, bore away</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To North or South, without a note of song.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All these were Vera's playmates; and she loved</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To watch them, wondering oftentimes how well</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They knew their parts, and how the drama moved</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="104" id="page104"/>
<span class="i0">So swiftly, smoothly on from scene to scene</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Without confusion. But she sometimes dreamed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There must be something hidden in the play</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unknown to her, an utterance of life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">More clear than action and more deep than looks.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And this she felt most deeply when she watched</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Her human comrades and the throngs of men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who met and parted oft with moving lips</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That had a meaning more than she could see.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She saw a lover bend above a maid,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With moving lips; and though he touched her not</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A sudden rose of joy bloomed in her face.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She saw a hater stand before his foe</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And move his lips; whereat the other shrank</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As if he had been smitten on the mouth.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She saw the regiments of toiling men</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Marshalled in ranks and led by moving lips.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And once she saw a sight more strange than all:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A crowd of people sitting charmed and still</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Around a little company of men</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who touched their hands in measured, rhythmic time</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To curious instruments; a woman stood</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Among them, with bright eyes and heaving breast,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And lifted up her face and moved her lips.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then Vera wondered at the idle play,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But when she looked around, she saw the glow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of deep delight on every face, as if</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Some visitor from a celestial world</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="105" id="page105"/>
<span class="i0">Had brought glad tidings. But to her alone</span><br/>
<span class="i0">No angel entered, for the choir of sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was vacant in the temple of her soul,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And worship lacked her golden crown of song.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when by vision baffled and perplexed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She saw that all the world could not be seen,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And knew she could not know the whole of life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unless a hidden gate should be unsealed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She felt imprisoned. In her heart there grew</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The bitter creeping plant of discontent,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The plant that only grows in prison soil,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Whose root is hunger and whose fruit is pain.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The springs of still delight and tranquil joy</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Were drained as dry as desert dust to feed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That never-flowering vine, whose tendrils clung</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With strangling touch around the bloom of life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And made it wither. Vera could not rest</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Within the limits of her silent world;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Along its dumb and desolate paths she roamed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A captive, looking sadly for escape.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now in those distant days, and in that land</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Remote, there lived a Master wonderful,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who knew the secret of all life, and could,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With gentle touches and with potent words,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Open all gates that ever had been sealed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And loose all prisoners whom Fate had bound.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="106" id="page106"/>
<span class="i0">Obscure he dwelt, not in the wilderness,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But in a hut among the throngs of men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Concealed by meekness and simplicity.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And ever as he walked the city streets,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or sat in quietude beside the sea,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or trod the hillsides and the harvest fields,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The multitude passed by and knew him not.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But there were some who knew, and turned to him</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For help; and unto all who asked, he gave.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thus Vera came, and found him in the field,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And knew him by the pity in his face.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She knelt to him and held him by one hand,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And laid the other hand upon her lips</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In mute entreaty. Then she lifted up</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The coils of hair that hung about her neck,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And bared the beauty of the gates of sound,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Those virgin gates through which no voice had passed,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She made them bare before the Master's sight,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And looked into the kindness of his face</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With eyes that spoke of all her prisoned pain,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And told her great desire without a word.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Master waited long in silent thought,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As one reluctant to bestow a gift,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not for the sake of holding back the thing</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Entreated, but because he surely knew</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of something better that he fain would give</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If only she would ask it. Then he stooped</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="107" id="page107"/>
<span class="i0">To Vera, smiling, touched her ears and spoke:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Open, fair gates, and you, reluctant doors,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Within the ivory labyrinth of the ear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Let fall the bar of silence and unfold!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Enter, you voices of all living things,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Enter the garden sealed,—but softly, slowly,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not with a noise confused and broken tumult,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Come in an order sweet as I command you,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And bring the double gift of speech and hearing.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vera began to hear. At first the wind</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Breathed a low prelude of the birth of sound,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As if an organ far away were touched</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By unseen fingers; then the little stream</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That hurried down the hillside, swept the harp</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of music into merry, tinkling notes;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And then the lark that poised above her head</span><br/>
<span class="i0">On wings a-quiver, overflowed the air</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With showers of song; and one by one the tones</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of all things living, in an order sweet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Without confusion and with deepening power,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Entered the garden sealed. And last of all</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Master's voice, the human voice divine,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Passed through the gates and called her by her name,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And Vera heard.</span></p>
<h4><a class="pagebreak" title="108" id="page108"/>
II</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i8">                What rapture of new life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Must come to one for whom a silent world</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is suddenly made vocal, and whose heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By the same magic is awaked at once,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Without the learner's toil and long delay,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Out of a night of dumbly moving dreams,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Into a day that overflows with music!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This joy was Vera's; and to her it seemed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As if a new creative morn had risen</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Upon the earth, and after the full week</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When living things unfolded silently,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And after the long, quiet Sabbath day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When all was still, another day had dawned,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And through the calm expectancy of heaven</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A secret voice had said, “Let all things speak.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The world responded with an instant joy;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all the unseen avenues of sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Were thronged with varying forms of viewless life.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To every living thing a voice was given</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Distinct and personal. The forest trees</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Were not more varied in their shades of green</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Than in their tones of speech; and every bird</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That nested in their branches had a song</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unknown to other birds and all his own.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The waters spoke a hundred dialects</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="109" id="page109"/>
<span class="i0">Of one great language; now with pattering fall</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of raindrops on the glistening leaves, and now</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With steady roar of rivers rushing down</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To meet the sea, and now with rhythmic throb</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And measured tumult of tempestuous waves,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And now with lingering lisp of creeping tides,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The manifold discourse of many waters.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But most of all the human voice was full</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of infinite variety, and ranged</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Along the scale of life's experience</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With changing tones, and notes both sweet and sad,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All fitted to express some unseen thought,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Some vital motion of the hidden heart.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So Vera listened with her new-born sense</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To all the messengers that passed the gates,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In measureless delight and utter trust,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Believing that they brought a true report</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From every living thing of its true life,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And hoping that at last they would make clear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The mystery and the meaning of the world.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But soon there came a trouble in her joy,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A note discordant that dissolved the chord</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And broke the bliss of hearing into pain.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not from the harsher sounds and voices wild</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of anger and of anguish, that reveal</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The secret strife in nature, and confess</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The touch of sorrow on the heart of life,—</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="110" id="page110"/>
<span class="i0">From these her trouble came not. For in these,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">However sad, she felt the note of truth,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And truth, though sad, is always musical.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The raging of the tempest-ridden sea,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The crash of thunder, and the hollow moan</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of winds complaining round the mountain-crags,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The shrill and quavering cry of birds of prey,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The fiercer roar of conflict-loving beasts,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All these wild sounds are potent in their place</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Within life's mighty symphony; the charm</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of truth attunes them, and the hearing ear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Finds pleasure in their rude sincerity.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Even the broken and tumultuous noise</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That rises from great cities, where the heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of human toil is beating heavily</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With ceaseless murmurs of the labouring pulse,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is not a discord; for it speaks to life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of life unfeigned, and full of hopes and fears,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And touched through all the trouble of its notes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With something real and therefore glorious.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One voice alone of all that sound on earth,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is hateful to the soul, and full of pain,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The voice of falsehood. So when Vera heard</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This mocking voice, and knew that it was false;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When first she learned that human lips can speak</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The thing that is not, and betray the ear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of simple trust with treachery of words;</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="111" id="page111"/>
<span class="i0">The joy of hearing withered in her heart.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For now she felt that faithless messengers</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Could pass the open and unguarded gates</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of sound, and bring a message all untrue,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or half a truth that makes the deadliest lie,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or idle babble, neither false nor true,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But hollow to the heart, and meaningless.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She heard the flattering voices of deceit,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That mask the hidden purposes of men</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With fair attire of favourable words,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And hide the evil in the guise of good:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The voices vain and decorous and smooth,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That fill the world with empty-hearted talk;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The foolish voices, wandering and confused,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That never clearly speak the thing they would,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But ramble blindly round their true intent</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And tangle sense in hopeless coils of sound,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All these she heard, and with a deep mistrust</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Began to doubt the value of her gift.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It seemed as if the world, the living world,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sincere, and vast, and real, were still concealed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And she, within the prison of her soul,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Still waiting silently to hear the voice</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of perfect knowledge and of perfect peace.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So with the burden of her discontent</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She turned to seek the Master once again,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And found him sitting in the market-place,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="112" id="page112"/>
<span class="i0">Half-hidden in the shadow of a porch,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Alone among the careless crowd.</span><br/>
<span class="i16">                                She spoke:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Thy gift was great, dear Master, and my heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Has thanked thee many times because I hear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But I have learned that hearing is not all;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For underneath the speech of men, there flows</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Another current of their hidden thoughts;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Behind the mask of language I perceive</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The eyes of things unsaid.</span><br/>
<span class="i14">                            Touch me again,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">O Master, with thy liberating hand,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And free me from the bondage of deceit.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Open another gate, and let me hear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The secret thoughts and purposes of men;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For only thus my heart will be at rest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And only thus, at last, I shall perceive</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The mystery and the meaning of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Master's face was turned aside from her;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His eyes looked far away, as if he saw</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Something beyond her sight; and yet she knew</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That he was listening; for her pleading voice</span><br/>
<span class="i0">No sooner ceased than he put forth his hand</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To touch her brow, and very gently spoke:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Thou seekest for thyself a wondrous gift,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The opening of the second gate, a gift</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That many wise men have desired in vain:</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="113" id="page113"/>
<span class="i0">But some have found it,—whether well or ill</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For their own peace, they have attained the power</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To hear unspoken thoughts of other men.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And thou hast begged this gift? Thou shalt receive,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not knowing what thou seekest,—it is thine:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The second gate is open! Thou shalt hear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All that men think and feel within their hearts:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thy prayer is granted, daughter, go thy way!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But if thou findest sorrow on this path,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Come back again,—there is a path to peace.”</span></p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beyond our power of vision, poets say,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There is another world of forms unseen,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Yet visible to purer eyes than ours.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And if the crystal of our sight were clear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We should behold the mountain-slopes of cloud,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The moving meadows of the untilled sea,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The groves of twilight and the dales of dawn,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And every wide and lonely field of air,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">More populous than cities, crowded close</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With living creatures of all shapes and hues.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But if that sight were ours, the things that now</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Engage our eyes would seem but dull and dim</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beside the wonders of our new-found world,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And we should be amazed and overwhelmed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not knowing how to use the plenitude</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of vision.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="114" id="page114"/>
<span class="i6">            So in Vera's soul, at first,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The opening of the second gate of sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Let in confusion like a whirling flood.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The murmur of a myriad-throated mob;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The trampling of an army through a place</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where echoes hide; the sudden, whistling flight</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of an innumerable flock of birds</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Along the highway of the midnight sky;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The many-whispered rustling of the reeds</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beneath the passing feet of all the winds;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The long-drawn, inarticulate, wailing cry</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of million-pebbled beaches when the lash</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of stormy waves is drawn across their back,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All these were less bewildering than to hear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">What now she heard at once: the tangled sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of all that moves within the minds of men.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For now there was no measured flow of words</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To mark the time; nor any interval</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of silence to repose the listening ear.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But through the dead of night, and through the calm</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of weary noon-tide, through the solemn hush</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That fills the temple in the pause of praise,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And through the breathless awe in rooms of death,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She heard the ceaseless motion and the stir</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of never-silent hearts, that fill the world</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With interwoven thoughts of good and ill,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With mingled music of delight and grief,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With songs of love, and bitter cries of hate,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="115" id="page115"/>
<span class="i0">With hymns of faith, and dirges of despair,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And murmurs deeper and more vague than all,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thoughts that are born and die without a name,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or rather, never die, but haunt the soul,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With sad persistence, till a name is given.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">These Vera heard, at first with mind perplexed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And half-benumbed by the disordered sound.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But soon a clearer sense began to pierce</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The cloudy turmoil with discerning power.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She learned to know the tones of human thought</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As plainly as she knew the tones of speech.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She could divide the evil from the good,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Interpreting the language of the mind,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And tracing every feeling like a thread</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Within the mystic web the passions weave</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From heart to heart around the living world.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when at last the Master's second gift</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was perfected within her, and she heard</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And understood the secret thoughts of men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A sadness fell upon her, and the load</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of insupportable knowledge pressed her down</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With weary wishes to know more, or less.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For all she knew was like a broken word</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Inscribed upon the fragment of a ring;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all she heard was like a broken strain</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Preluding music that is never played.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="116" id="page116"/>
<span class="i0">Then she remembered in her sad unrest</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Master's parting word,—“a path to peace,”—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And turned again to seek him with her grief.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She found him in a hollow of the hills,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beside a little spring that issued forth</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beneath the rocks and filled a mossy cup</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With never-failing water. There he sat,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With waiting looks that welcomed her afar.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“I know that thou hast heard, my child,” he said,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“For all the wonder of the world of sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is written in thy face. But hast thou heard,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Among the many voices, one of peace?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And is thy heart that hears the secret thoughts,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The hidden wishes and desires of men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Content with hearing? Art thou satisfied?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Nay, Master,” she replied, “thou knowest well</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That I am not at rest, nor have I heard</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The voice of perfect peace; but what I hear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Brings me disquiet and a troubled mind.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The evil voices in the souls of men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Voices of rage and cruelty and fear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Have not dismayed me; for I have believed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The voices of the good, the kind, the true,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Are more in number and excel in strength.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There is more love than hate, more hope than fear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the deep throbbing of the human heart.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But while I listen to the troubled sound,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">One thing torments me, and destroys my rest</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="117" id="page117"/>
<span class="i0">And presses me with dull, unceasing pain.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For out of all the minds of all mankind,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There rises evermore a questioning voice</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That asks the meaning of this mighty world</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And finds no answer,—asks, and asks again,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With patient pleading or with wild complaint,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But wakens no response, except the sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of other questions, wandering to and fro,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From other souls in doubt. And so this voice</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Persists above all others that I hear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And binds them up together into one,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Until the mingled murmur of the world</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sounds through the inner temple of my heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like an eternal question, vainly asked</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By every human soul that thinks and feels.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This is the heaviness that weighs me down,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And this the pain that will not let me rest.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Therefore, dear Master, shut the gates again,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And let me live in silence as before!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or else,—and if there is indeed a gate</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unopened yet, through which I might receive</span><br/>
<span class="i0">An answer in the voice of perfect peace—”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She ceased; and in her upward faltering tone</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The question echoed.</span><br/>
<span class="i11">                      Then the Master said:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“There is another gate, not yet unclosed.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For through the outer portal of the ear</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="118" id="page118"/>
<span class="i0">Only the outer voice of things may pass;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And through the middle doorway of the mind</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Only the half-formed voice of human thoughts,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Uncertain and perplexed with endless doubt;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But through the inmost gate the spirit hears</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The voice of that great Spirit who is Life.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beneath the tones of living things He breathes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A deeper tone than ever ear hath heard;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And underneath the troubled thoughts of men</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He thinks forever, and His thought is peace.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Behold, I touch thee once again, my child:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The third and last of those three hidden gates</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That closed around thy soul and shut thee in,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is open now, and thou shalt truly hear.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Vera heard. The spiritual gate</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was opened softly as a full-blown flower</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unfolds its heart to welcome in the dawn,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And on her listening face there shone a light</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of still amazement and completed joy</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the full gift of hearing.</span><br/>
<span class="i15">                              What she heard</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I cannot tell; nor could she ever tell</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In words; because all human words are vain.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There is no speech nor language, to express</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The secret messages of God, that make</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Perpetual music in the hearing heart.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Below the voice of waters, and above</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="119" id="page119"/>
<span class="i0">The wandering voice of winds, and underneath</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The song of birds, and all the varying tones</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of living things that fill the world with sound,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">God spoke to her, and what she heard was peace.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the Master questioned, “Dost thou hear?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She answered, “Yea, at last I hear.” And then</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He asked her once again, “What hearest thou?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">What means the voice of Life?” She answered, “Love!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For love is life, and they who do not love</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Are not alive. But every soul that loves,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lives in the heart of God and hears Him speak.”</span></p>

A LEGEND OF SERVICE</h3>

<span class="i0">And some were glad because their eyes had seen,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Along its banks, fresh flowers and living green.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">At last, before the whiteness of the throne</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The youngest angel, Asmiel, stood alone;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Nor glad, nor sad, but full of earnest thought,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And thus his tidings to the Master brought</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Lord, in the city Lupon I have found</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Three servants of thy holy name, renowned</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Above their fellows. One is very wise,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With thoughts that ever range beyond the skies;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And one is gifted with the golden speech</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That makes men gladly hear when he will teach;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And one, with no rare gift or grace endued,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Has won the people's love by doing good.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With three such saints Lupon is trebly blest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But, Lord, I fain would know, which loves Thee best?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then spake the Lord of Angels, to whose look</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The hearts of all are like an open book:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“In every soul the secret thought I read,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="126" id="page126"/>
<span class="i0">And well I know who loves me best indeed.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But every life has pages vacant still,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Whereon a man may write the thing he will;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Therefore I read the record, day by day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But thou shalt go to Lupon, to the three</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who serve me there, and take this word from me:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Tell each of them his Master bids him go</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There he shall find a certain task for me:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But what, I do not tell to them nor thee.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Give thou the message, make my word the test,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And crown for me the one who loves me best.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Silent the angel stood, with folded hands,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To take the imprint of his Lord's commands;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then drew one breath, obedient and elate,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And passed the self-same hour, through Lupon's gate.</span></p>
<hr class="dotted"/>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First to the Temple door he made his way;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And there, because it was a holy-day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He saw the folk in thousands thronging, stirred</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By ardent thirst to hear the preacher's word.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then, while the people whispered Bernol's name,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Through aisles that hushed behind him Bernol came;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Strung to the keenest pitch of conscious might,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With lips prepared and firm, and eyes alight.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">One moment at the pulpit step he knelt</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In silent prayer, and on his shoulder felt</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="127" id="page127"/>
<span class="i0">The angel's hand:—“The Master bids thee go</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To serve Him there.” Then Bernol's hidden face</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Went white as death, and for about the space</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Till Bernol looked around and whispered, “<i>Why?</i>”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But answer to his question came there none;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The angel sighed, and with a sigh was gone.</span></p>
<hr class="dotted"/>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within the humble house where Malvin spent</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His studious years, on holy things intent,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sweet stillness reigned; and there the angel found</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The saintly sage immersed in thought profound,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Weaving with patient toil and willing care</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A web of wisdom, wonderful and fair:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A seamless robe for Truth's great bridal meet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And needing but one thread to be complete.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then Asmiel touched his hand, and broke the thread</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of fine-spun thought, and very gently said,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“The One of whom thou thinkest bids thee go</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To serve Him there.” With sorrow and surprise</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Malvin looked up, reluctance in his eyes.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The broken thought, the strangeness of the call,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The perilous passage of the mountain-wall,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The solitary journey, and the length</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of ways unknown, too great for his frail strength,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Appalled him. With a doubtful brow</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="128" id="page128"/>
<span class="i0">He scanned the doubtful task, and muttered “<i>How?</i>”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But Asmiel answered, as he turned to go,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With cold, disheartened voice, “I do not know.”</span></p>
<hr class="dotted"/>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now as he went, with fading hope, to seek</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The third and last to whom God bade him speak,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Scarce twenty steps away whom should he meet</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But Fermor, hurrying cheerful down the street,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With ready heart that faced his work like play,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And joyed to find it greater every day!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The angel stopped him with uplifted hand,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And gave without delay his Lord's command:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“He whom thou servest here would have thee go</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To serve Him there.” Ere Asmiel breathed again</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The eager answer leaped to meet him, “<i>When?</i>”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The angel's face with inward joy grew bright,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all his figure glowed with heavenly light;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He took the golden circlet from his brow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And gave the crown to Fermor, answering, “Now!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For thou hast met the Master's hidden test,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And I have found the man who loves Him best.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not thine, nor mine, to question or reply</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When He commands us, asking ‘how?’ or ‘why?’</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He knows the cause; His ways are wise and just;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who serves the King must serve with perfect trust.”</span></p>

THE WHITE BEES</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<h4>LEGEND</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long ago Apollo called to Aristæus, youngest of the shepherds,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Saying, “I will make you keeper of my bees.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Golden were the hives and golden was the honey; golden, too, the music</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Where the honey-makers hummed among the trees.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy Aristæus loitered in the garden, wandered in the orchard,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Careless and contented, indolent and free;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lightly took his labour, lightly took his pleasure, till the fated moment</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  When across his pathway came Eurydice.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then her eyes enkindled burning love within him; drove him wild with longing</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  For the perfect sweetness of her flower-like face;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Eagerly he followed, while she fled before him, over mead and mountain,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  On through field and forest, in a breathless race.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the nymph, in flying, trod upon a serpent; like a dream she vanished;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Pluto's chariot bore her down among the dead!</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="130" id="page130"/>
<span class="i0">Lonely Aristæus, sadly home returning, found his garden empty,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  All the hives deserted, all the music fled.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mournfully bewailing,—“Ah, my honey-makers, where have you departed?”</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Far and wide he sought them over sea and shore;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Foolish is the tale that says he ever found them, brought them home in triumph,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Joys that once escape us fly for evermore.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet I dream that somewhere, clad in downy whiteness, dwell the honey-makers,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In aërial gardens that no mortal sees:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And at times returning, lo, they flutter round us, gathering mystic harvest,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  So I weave the legend of the long-lost bees.</span></p>
<h4>II</h4>
<h4>THE SWARMING OF THE BEES</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who can tell the hiding of the white bees' nest?</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Who can trace the guiding of their swift home flight?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Far would be his riding on a life-long quest:</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Surely ere it ended would his beard grow white.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never in the coming of the rose-red Spring,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Never in the passing of the wine-red Fall,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="131" id="page131"/>
<span class="i0">May you hear the humming of the white bee's wing</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Murmur o'er the meadow ere the night bells call.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wait till winter hardens in the cold gray sky,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Wait till leaves are fallen and the brooks all freeze,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then above the gardens where the dead flowers lie,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Swarm the merry millions of the wild white bees.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i3">      Out of the high-built airy hive,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Deep in the clouds that veil the sun,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Look how the first of the swarm arrive;</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Timidly venturing, one by one,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Down through the tranquil air,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Wavering here and there,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Large, and lazy in flight,—</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Caught by a lift of the breeze,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Tangled among the naked trees,—</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Dropping then, without a sound,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Feather-white, feather-light,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      To their rest on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i3">      Thus the swarming is begun.</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Count the leaders, every one</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Perfect as a perfect star</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Till the slow descent is done.</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Look beyond them, see how far</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Down the vistas dim and gray,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Multitudes are on the way.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="132" id="page132"/>
<span class="i3">      Now a sudden brightness</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Dawns within the sombre day,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Over fields of whiteness;</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      And the sky is swiftly alive</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      With the flutter and the flight</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Of the shimmering bees, that pour</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      From the hidden door of the hive</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Till you can count no more.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now on the branches of hemlock and pine</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thickly they settle and cluster and swing,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Bending them low; and the trellised vine</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the dark elm-boughs are traced with a line</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of beauty wherever the white bees cling.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Now they are hiding the wrecks of the flowers,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Softly, softly, covering all,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Over the grave of the summer hours</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Spreading a silver pall.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Now they are building the broad roof ledge,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Into a cornice smooth and fair,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Moulding the terrace, from edge to edge,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Into the sweep of a marble stair.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Wonderful workers, swift and dumb,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Numberless myriads, still they come,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thronging ever faster, faster, faster!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where is their queen? Who is their master?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The gardens are faded, the fields are frore,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">What is the honey they toil to store</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="133" id="page133"/>
<span class="i0">In the desolate day, where no blossoms gleam?</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>Forgetfulness and a dream!</i></span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now the fretful wind awakes;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I hear him girding at the trees;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He strikes the bending boughs, and shakes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The quiet clusters of the bees</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    To powdery drift;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  He tosses them away,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  He drives them like spray;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He makes them veer and shift</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Around his blustering path.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In clouds blindly whirling,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In rings madly swirling,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Full of crazy wrath,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So furious and fast they fly</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They blur the earth and blot the sky</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    In wild, white mirk.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They fill the air with frozen wings</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And tiny, angry, icy stings;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They blind the eyes, and choke the breath,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They dance a maddening dance of death</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Around their work,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sweeping the cover from the hill,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Heaping the hollows deeper still,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Effacing every line and mark,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And swarming, storming in the dark</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Through the long night;</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="134" id="page134"/>
<span class="i0">Until, at dawn, the wind lies down</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Weary of fight;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The last torn cloud, with trailing gown,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Passes the open gates of light;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the white bees are lost in flight.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Look how the landscape glitters wide and still,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Bright with a pure surprise!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The day begins with joy, and all past ill,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Buried in white oblivion, lies</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beneath the snow-drifts under crystal skies.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">New hope, new love, new life, new cheer,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Flow in the sunrise beam,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The gladness of Apollo when he sees,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Upon the bosom of the wintry year,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The honey-harvest of his wild white bees,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>Forgetfulness and a dream!</i></span></p>

<h4>LEGEND</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Listen, my beloved, while the silver morning, like a tranquil vision,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Fills the world around us and our hearts with peace;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Quiet is the close of Aristæus' legend, happy is the ending—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Listen while I tell you how he found release.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="135" id="page135"/>
<span class="i0">Many months he wandered far away in sadness, desolately thinking</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Only of the vanished joys he could not find;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Till the great Apollo, pitying his shepherd, loosed him from the burden</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of a dark, reluctant, backward-looking mind.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he saw around him all the changeful beauty of the changing seasons,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In the world-wide regions where his journey lay;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Birds that sang to cheer him, flowers that bloomed beside him, stars that shone to guide him,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Traveller's joy was plenty all along the way!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Everywhere he journeyed strangers made him welcome, listened while he taught them</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Secret lore of field and forest he had learned:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">How to train the vines and make the olives fruitful; how to guard the sheepfolds;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  How to stay the fever when the dog-star burned.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Friendliness and blessing followed in his footsteps; richer were the harvests,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Happier the dwellings, wheresoe'er he came;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Little children loved him, and he left behind him, in the hour of parting,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Memories of kindness and a god-like name.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="136" id="page136"/>
<span class="i0">So he travelled onward, desolate no longer, patient in his seeking,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Reaping all the wayside comfort of his quest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Till at last in Thracia, high upon Mount Hæmus, far from human dwelling,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Weary Aristæus laid him down to rest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the honey-makers, clad in downy whiteness, fluttered soft around him,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Wrapt him in a dreamful slumber pure and deep.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This is life, beloved: first a sheltered garden, then a troubled journey,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Joy and pain of seeking,—and at last we sleep!</span></p>

NEW YEAR'S EVE</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The other night I had a dream, most clear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And comforting, complete</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In every line, a crystal sphere,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And full of intimate and secret cheer.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Therefore I will repeat</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That vision, dearest heart, to you,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As of a thing not feigned, but very true,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Yes, true as ever in my life befell;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And you, perhaps, can tell</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Whether my dream was really sad or sweet.</span></p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The shadows flecked the elm-embowered street</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I knew so well, long, long ago;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And on the pillared porch where Marguerite</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Had sat with me, the moonlight lay like snow.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But she, my comrade and my friend of youth,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Most gaily wise,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Most innocently loved,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She of the blue-gray eyes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That ever smiled and ever spoke the truth,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From that familiar dwelling, where she moved</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like mirth incarnate in the years before,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Had gone into the hidden house of Death.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="138" id="page138"/>
<span class="i0">I thought the garden wore</span><br/>
<span class="i0">White mourning for her blessed innocence,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the syringa's breath</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Came from the corner by the fence</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where she had made her rustic seat,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With fragrance passionate, intense,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As if it breathed a sigh for Marguerite.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">My heart was heavy with a sense</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of something good for ever gone. I sought</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Vainly for some consoling thought,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Some comfortable word that I could say</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To her sad father, whom I visited again</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For the first time since she had gone away.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The bell rang shrill and lonely,—then</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The door was opened, and I sent my name</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To him,—but ah! 'twas Marguerite who came!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There in the dear old dusky room she stood</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beneath the lamp, just as she used to stand,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In tender mocking mood.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“You did not ask for me,” she said,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“And so I will not let you take my hand;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But I must hear what secret talk you planned</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With father. Come, my friend, be good,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And tell me your affairs of state:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Why you have stayed away and made me wait</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So long. Sit down beside me here,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And, do you know, it seems a year</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Since we have talked together,—why so late?”</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="139" id="page139"/>
<span class="i0">Amazed, incredulous, confused with joy</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I hardly dared to show,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And stammering like a boy,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I took the place she showed me at her side;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And then the talk flowed on with brimming tide</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Through the still night,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While she with influence light</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Controlled it, as the moon the flood.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She knew where I had been, what I had done,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">What work was planned, and what begun;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">My troubles, failures, fears she understood,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And touched them with a heart so kind,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That every care was melted from my mind,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And every hope grew bright,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And life seemed moving on to happy ends.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">(Ah, what self-beggared fool was he</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That said a woman cannot be</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The very best of friends?)</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then there were memories of old times,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Recalled with many a gentle jest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And at the last she brought the book of rhymes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We made together, trying to translate</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Songs of Heine (hers were always best).</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Now come,” she said,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“To-night we will collaborate</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Again; I'll put you to the test.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Here's one I never found the way to do,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The simplest are the hardest ones, you know,—</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="140" id="page140"/>
<span class="i0">I give this song to you.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And then she read:</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      <i>Mein Kind, wir waren Kinder,</i></span><br/>
<span class="i3">      <i>Zwei Kinder, jung und froh.</i></span></p>
<hr class="dotted"/>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But all the while, a silent question stirred</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Within me, though I dared not speak the word:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Is it herself, and is she truly here,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And was I dreaming when I heard</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That she was dead last year?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or was it true, and is she but a shade</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who brings a fleeting joy to eye and ear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Cold though so kind, and will she gently fade</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When her sweet ghostly part is played</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the light-curtain falls at dawn of day?”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But while my heart was troubled by this fear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So deeply that I could not speak it out,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lest all my happiness should disappear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I thought me of a cunning way</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To hide the question and dissolve the doubt.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Will you not give me now your hand,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Dear Marguerite,” I asked, “to touch and hold,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That by this token I may understand</span><br/>
<span class="i0">You are the same true friend you were of old?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">She answered with a smile so bright and calm</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It seemed as if I saw the morn arise</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the deep heaven of her eyes;</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="141" id="page141"/>
<span class="i0">And smiling so, she laid her palm</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In mine. Dear God, it was not cold</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But warm with vital heat!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“You live!” I cried, “you live, dear Marguerite!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When I awoke; but strangely comforted,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Although I knew again that she was dead.</span></p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, there's the dream! And was it sweet or sad?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Dear mistress of my waking and my sleep,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Present reward of all my heart's desire,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Watching with me beside the winter fire,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">The touch of you: for the Old Year with storm</span><br/>

<span class="i0">The corners of the house,—and oh! my heart would break</span><br/>

THE VAIN KING</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In robes of Tyrian blue the King was drest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A jewelled collar shone upon his breast,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A giant ruby glittered in his crown:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lord of rich lands and many a splendid town,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In him the glories of an ancient line</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of sober kings, who ruled by right divine,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Were centred; and to him with loyal awe</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The people looked for leadership and law.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand knights, the safeguard of the land,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Were like a single sword within his hand;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A hundred courts, with power of life and death,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all the sacred growths that men had known</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of order and of rule upheld his throne.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proud was the King: yet not with such a heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As fits a man to play a royal part.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not his the pride that honours as a trust</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The right to rule, the duty to be just:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not his the dignity that bends to bear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The monarch's yoke, the master's load of care,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And labours like the peasant at his gate,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To serve the people and protect the State.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Another pride was his, and other joys:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To him the crown and sceptre were but toys,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="143" id="page143"/>
<span class="i0">With which he played at glory's idle game,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To please himself and win the wreaths of fame.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The throne his fathers held from age to age,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To his ambition seemed a fitting stage</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Built for King Martin to display at will,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His mighty strength and universal skill.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">No conscious child, that, spoiled with praising, tries</span><br/>
<span class="i0">At every step to win admiring eyes,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">No favourite mountebank, whose acting draws</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From gaping crowds the thunder of applause,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was vainer than the King: his only thirst</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was to be hailed, in every race, the first.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When tournament was held, in knightly guise</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The King would ride the lists and win the prize;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When music charmed the court, with golden lyre</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The King would take the stage and lead the choir;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In hunting, his the lance to slay the boar;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In hawking, see his falcon highest soar;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In painting, he would wield the master's brush;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In high debate,—“the King is speaking! Hush!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thus, with a restless heart, in every field</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He sought renown, and made his subjects yield.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But while he played the petty games of life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His kingdom fell a prey to inward strife;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Corruption through the court unheeded crept,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And on the seat of honour justice slept.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The strong trod down the weak; the helpless poor</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Groaned under burdens grievous to endure;</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="144" id="page144"/>
<span class="i0">The nation's wealth was spent in vain display,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And weakness wore the nation's heart away.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet think not Earth is blind to human woes—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Man has more friends and helpers than he knows;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And when a patient people are oppressed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The land that bore them feels it in her breast.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Spirits of field and flood, of heath and hill,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Are grieved and angry at the spreading ill;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The trees complain together in the night,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Voices of wrath are heard along the height,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And secret vows are sworn, by stream and strand,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To bring the tyrant low and free the land.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But little recked the pampered King of these;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He heard no voice but such as praise and please.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Flattered and fooled, victor in every sport,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">One day he wandered idly with his court</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Beside the river, seeking to devise</span><br/>
<span class="i0">New ways to show his skill to wondering eyes.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There in the stream a patient angler stood,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And cast his line across the rippling flood.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His silver spoil lay near him on the green:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Such fish,” the courtiers cried, “were never seen!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Three salmon longer than a cloth-yard shaft—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This man must be the master of his craft!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“An easy art!” the jealous King replied:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Myself could learn it better, if I tried,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="145" id="page145"/>
<span class="i0">And catch a hundred larger fish a week—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou accept the challenge, fellow? Speak!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The angler turned, came near, and bent his knee:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“'Tis not for kings to strive with such as me;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Yet if the King commands it, I obey.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But one condition of the strife I pray:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The fisherman who brings the least to land</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Shall do whate'er the other may command.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Loud laughed the King: “A foolish fisher thou!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For I shall win, and rule thee then as now.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then to Prince John, a sober soul, sedate</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And slow, King Martin left the helm of State,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While to the novel game with eager zest</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He all his time and all his powers addressed.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sure such a sight was never seen before!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In robe and crown the monarch trod the shore;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His golden hooks were decked with feathers fine,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His jewelled reel ran out a silken line.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With kingly strokes he flogged the crystal stream;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Far-off the salmon saw his tackle gleam;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Careless of kings, they eyed with calm disdain</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The gaudy lure, and Martin fished in vain.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">On Friday, when the week was almost spent,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He scanned his empty creel with discontent,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Called for a net, and cast it far and wide,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And drew—a thousand minnows from the tide!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then came the angler to conclude the match,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="146" id="page146"/>
<span class="i0">And at the monarch's feet spread out his catch—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A hundred salmon, greater than before.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“I win!” he cried: “the King must pay the score.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then Martin, angry, threw his tackle down:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Rather than lose this game I'd lose my crown!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Nay, thou hast lost them both,” the angler said;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And as he spoke a wondrous light was shed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Around his form; he dropped his garments mean,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And in his place the River-god was seen.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Thy vanity has brought thee in my power,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And thou must pay the forfeit at this hour:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For thou hast shown thyself a royal fool,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Too proud to angle, and too vain to rule,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Eager to win in every trivial strife,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Go! Thou shalt fish for minnows all thy life!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Wrathful, the King the magic sentence heard;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He strove to answer, but he only <i>chirr-r-ed</i>:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His royal robe was changed to wings of blue,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His crown a ruby crest,—away he flew!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So every summer day along the stream</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The vain King-fisher darts, an azure gleam,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And scolds the angler with a mocking scream.</span></p>

THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">    <i>A tale that the poet Rückert told</i></span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>To German children, in days of old;</i></span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>Disguised in a random, rollicking rhyme</i></span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>Like a merry mummer of ancient time,</i></span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>And sent, in its English dress, to please</i></span><br/>
<span class="i2">    <i>The little folk of the Christmas trees.</i></span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little fir grew in the midst of the wood</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Contented and happy, as young trees should.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His body was straight and his boughs were clean;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And summer and winter the bountiful sheen</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of his needles bedecked him, from top to root,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In a beautiful, all-the-year, evergreen suit.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But a trouble came into his heart one day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When he saw that the other trees were gay</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the wonderful raiment that summer weaves</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of manifold shapes and kinds of leaves:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He looked at his needles so stiff and small,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And thought that his dress was the poorest of all.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then jealousy clouded the little tree's mind,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And he said to himself, “It was not very kind</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To give such an ugly old dress to a tree!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If the fays of the forest would only ask me,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I'd tell them how I should like to be dressed,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In a garment of gold, to bedazzle the rest!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So he fell asleep, but his dreams were bad.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="148" id="page148"/>
<span class="i0">When he woke in the morning, his heart was glad;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For every leaf that his boughs could hold</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was made of the brightest beaten gold.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I tell you, children, the tree was proud;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He was something above the common crowd;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And he tinkled his leaves, as if he would say</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To a pedlar who happened to pass that way,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Just look at me! Don't you think I am fine?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And wouldn't you like such a dress as mine?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Oh, yes!” said the man, “and I really guess</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I must fill my pack with your beautiful dress.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So he picked the golden leaves with care,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And left the little tree shivering there.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, why did I wish for golden leaves?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The fir-tree said, “I forgot that thieves</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Would be sure to rob me in passing by.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If the fairies would give me another try,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I'd wish for something that cost much less,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And be satisfied with glass for my dress!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then he fell asleep; and, just as before,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The fairies granted his wish once more.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When the night was gone, and the sun rose clear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The tree was a crystal chandelier;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And it seemed, as he stood in the morning light,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That his branches were covered with jewels bright.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Aha!” said the tree. “This is something great!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And he held himself up, very proud and straight;</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="149" id="page149"/>
<span class="i0">But a rude young wind through the forest dashed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In a reckless temper, and quickly smashed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The delicate leaves. With a clashing sound</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They broke into pieces and fell on the ground,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like a silvery, shimmering shower of hail,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the tree stood naked and bare to the gale.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then his heart was sad; and he cried, “Alas</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For my beautiful leaves of shining glass!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Perhaps I have made another mistake</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In choosing a dress so easy to break.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If the fairies only would hear me again</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I'd ask them for something both pretty and plain:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It wouldn't cost much to grant my request,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In leaves of green lettuce I'd like to be dressed!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By this time the fairies were laughing, I know;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But they gave him his wish in a second; and so</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With leaves of green lettuce, all tender and sweet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The tree was arrayed, from his head to his feet.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“I knew it!” he cried, “I was sure I could find</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The sort of a suit that would be to my mind.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There's none of the trees has a prettier dress,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And none as attractive as I am, I guess.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But a goat, who was taking an afternoon walk,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By chance overheard the fir-tree's talk.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So he came up close for a nearer view;—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“My salad!” he bleated, “I think so too!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">You're the most attractive kind of a tree,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="150" id="page150"/>
<span class="i0">And I want your leaves for my five-o'clock tea.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So he ate them all without saying grace,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And walked away with a grin on his face;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While the little tree stood in the twilight dim,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With never a leaf on a single limb.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he sighed and groaned; but his voice was weak—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He was so ashamed that he could not speak.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He knew at last he had been a fool,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To think of breaking the forest rule,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And choosing a dress himself to please,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Because he envied the other trees.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But it couldn't be helped, it was now too late,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He must make up his mind to a leafless fate!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So he let himself sink in a slumber deep,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But he moaned and he tossed in his troubled sleep,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Till the morning touched him with joyful beam,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And he woke to find it was all a dream.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For there in his evergreen dress he stood,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A pointed fir in the midst of the wood!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His branches were sweet with the balsam smell,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His needles were green when the white snow fell.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And always contented and happy was he,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The very best kind of a Christmas tree.</span></p>

AN HOUR</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You only promised me a single hour:</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  But in that hour I journeyed through a year</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of life: the joy of finding you,—the fear</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of losing you again,—the sense of power</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To make you all my own,—the sudden shower</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of tears that came because you were more dear</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Soft rapture when I plucked love's crimson flower.</span></p>

<span class="i1">  A year,—an hour? I knew not, for the stream</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of love had carried me to Paradise,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">The cradle I have made for thee</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Is carved of orient ivory,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And curtained round with wavy silk</span><br/>
<span class="i0">More white than hawthorn-bloom or milk.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A twig of box, a lilac spray,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Her happy dream and virgin sleep.</span></p>

<span class="i0">Within that pure and fragrant nest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I'll rock thy gentle soul to rest,</span><br/>

<h4>DREAMS</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Often I dream your big blue eyes,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Though loth their meaning to confess,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Regard me with a clear surprise</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of dawning tenderness.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Often I dream you gladly hear</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The words I hardly dare to breathe,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The words that falter in their fear</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To tell what throbs beneath.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Often I dream your hand in mine</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Falls like a flower at eventide,</span><br/>

<span class="i1">  Of footsteps side by side.</span></p>

<span class="i0">But ah, in all my dreams of bliss,</span><br/>

<h4>THE GARLAND OF SLEEP</h4>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Along the columned wall,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  From birth's low portal starting,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It flows, with even rise and fall,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To death's dark door of parting.</span></p>

<span class="i0">Whose presence were the joy and pang of death.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he who clings to sorrow overmuch,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Weeping for withered grief, has cause to bless,</span><br/>

<h4>THE OLD BRIDGE</h4>

<span class="i0">On the old, old bridge, where the lichens rust,</span><br/>

<h4>EYES AND LIPS</h4>
<h4>1</h4>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our deepening love, that is not yet allowed</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Another language than the eyes, doth learn</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Our looks exchange avowals and desires,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Like wave-divided beacon lights that burn,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And talk to one another by their fires.</span></p>
<h4>2</h4>

<span class="i0">Through you my soul will rise to make her mine.</span><br/>

<span class="i1">  Your look will shine with new delight, made sure</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By this forerunner of a faithful love.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Tis just, dear eyes, so pensive and so pure,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That you should bear the sealing kisses true</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of love unhoped that came to me through you.</span></p>
<h4>3</h4>

<span class="i0">This was my thought; but when beneath the rose</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Forgetting that you gave her to my arms,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I broke my promise; and my first caress,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Ungrateful, sought her lips in sweet surprise,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Her lips, which breathed a word of tenderness!</span></p>

<h4>AN EVOCATION</h4>
<p class="stanza">

<span class="i1">  Of purple dawn before the golden day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And ends the gloom it crosses at one leap.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  My brow was not unworthy your caress;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For some foreboding joy had bade me keep</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  From all affront the place your lips would bless.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet when your mouth upon my mouth did lay</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The royal touch, no rapture made me thrill,</span><br/>

<span class="i1">  Beneath your kiss, my queen without a stain,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I felt,—like ghosts who rise at Judgment Day,—</span><br/>

<span class="i0">And when the evening comes, no gentle brood</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of wondering children, gathered at my side,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Will soothe away the tears I cannot hide.</span></p>

<span class="i2">    The wild-rose ballad, the lilac-song,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The virginal chant of the lilies' throng,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Blue-bells silverly ringing,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Pansies merrily singing,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    For all the flowers have found their voice;</span><br/>

<span class="i0">While the river of dreams runs down.</span></p>

<span class="i2">    But never a face I have seen before.</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    They come and go, they shift and change,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">This is a city haunted,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A multitude enchanted!</span><br/>

<span class="i0">The river of dreams runs darkly down</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Into the heart of a desolate land,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Lamenting, wailing, weeping,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    I strive to cry out, but my fluttering breath</span><br/>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The river of dreams runs dimly down</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    By a secret way that no man knows;</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Through the gardens bright and the forests brown;</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And I often think that our whole life seems</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    To be more than half made up of dreams.</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The changing sights and the passing shows,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The morning hopes and the midnight fears,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Are left behind with the vanished years;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Onward, with ceaseless motion,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The life-stream flows to the ocean,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    While we follow the tide, awake or asleep,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Till we see the dawn on Love's great deep,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And the shadows melt, and the soul is free,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The river of dreams has reached the sea.</span></p>

ODE TO PEACE</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<h4>IN EXCELSIS</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two dwellings, Peace, are thine.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  One is the mountain-height,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Uplifted in the loneliness of light</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Beyond the realm of shadows,—fine,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And far, and clear,—where advent of the night</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Means only glorious nearness of the stars,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And dawn unhindered breaks above the bars</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That long the lower world in twilight keep.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thou sleepest not, and hast no need of sleep,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For all thy cares and fears have dropped away;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The night's fatigue, the fever-fret of day,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Are far below thee; and earth's weary wars,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In vain expense of passion, pass</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Before thy sight like visions in a glass,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or like the wrinkles of the storm that creep</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Across the sea and leave no trace</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of trouble on that immemorial face,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So brief appear the conflicts, and so slight</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The wounds men give, the things for which they fight!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Here hangs a fortress on the distant steep,—</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  A lichen clinging to the rock.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There sails a fleet upon the deep,—</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="236" id="page236"/>
<span class="i4">        A wandering flock</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of snow-winged gulls. And yonder, in the plain,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  A marble palace shines,—a grain</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of mica glittering in the rain.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Beneath thy feet the clouds are rolled</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  By voiceless winds: and far between</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The rolling clouds, new shores and peaks are seen,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In shimmering robes of green and gold,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And faint aerial hue</span><br/>

<span class="i0">All night, with eyes aware of loftier life</span><br/>

<span class="i0">And welcome to thy dwelling-place sublime</span><br/>

<span class="i0">To make a portion of earth's daily bread.</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The vast cloud-armies overhead</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Are marshalled, and the wild wind blows</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Dares to be true, and gladly takes its part</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In open converse, bringing forth its best:</span><br/>

<span class="i3">      Of lassitude and pain:</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="238" id="page238"/>
<span class="i0">And here, at last, is sleep with silent gifts,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Kind sleep, the tender nurse who lifts</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The soul grown weary of the waking world,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And lays it, with its thoughts all furled,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Its fears forgotten, and its passions still,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">On the deep bosom of the Eternal Will.</span></p>

THE WIND OF SORROW</h3>

THE ANCESTRAL DWELLINGS</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear to my heart are the ancestral dwellings of America,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Dearer than if they were haunted by ghosts of royal splendour;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They are simple enough to be great in their friendly dignity,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Homes that were built by the brave beginners of a nation.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I love the old white farmhouses nestled in New England valleys,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ample and long and low, with elm-trees feathering over them:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Borders of box in the yard, and lilacs, and old-fashioned roses,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A fan-light above the door, and little square panes in the windows,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The wood-shed piled with maple and birch and hickory ready for winter,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The gambrel-roof with its garret crowded with household relics,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All the tokens of prudent thrift and the spirit of self-reliance.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I love the weather-beaten, shingled houses that front the ocean;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They seem to grow out of the rocks, there is something indomitable about them:</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="290" id="page290"/>
<span class="i0">Their backs are bowed, and their sides are covered with lichens;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Soft in their colour as gray pearls, they are full of a patient courage.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Facing the briny wind on a lonely shore they stand undaunted,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While the thin blue pennant of smoke from the square-built chimney</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Tells of a haven for man, with room for a hearth and a cradle.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I love the stately southern mansions with their tall white columns,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They look through avenues of trees, over fields where the cotton is growing;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I can see the flutter of white frocks along their shady porches,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Music and laughter float from the windows, the yards are full of hounds and horses.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Long since the riders have ridden away, yet the houses have not forgotten,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They are proud of their name and place, and their doors are always open,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For the thing they remember best is the pride of their ancient hospitality.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="291" id="page291"/>
<span class="i0">In the towns I love the discreet and tranquil Quaker dwellings,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With their demure brick faces and immaculate marble doorsteps;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the gabled houses of the Dutch, with their high stoops and iron railings,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">(I can see their little brass knobs shining in the morning sunlight);</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the solid self-contained houses of the descendants of the Puritans,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Frowning on the street with their narrow doors and dormer-windows;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the triple-galleried, many-pillared mansions of Charleston,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Standing open sideways in their gardens of roses and magnolias.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, they are all dear to my heart, and in my eyes they are beautiful;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For under their roofs were nourished the thoughts that have made the nation;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The glory and strength of America come from her ancestral dwellings.</span></p>

HUDSON'S LAST VOYAGE</h3>
<h4>THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY</h4>
<h4>June 22, 1611</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One sail in sight upon the lonely sea,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And only one! For never ship but mine</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Has dared these waters. We were first,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">My men, to battle in between the bergs</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And floes to these wide waves. This gulf is mine;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I name it! and that flying sail is mine!</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Of mutineers, the bitches' whelps that snatched</span><br/>

<span class="i0">You Robert Juet, ancient, crafty man,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Toothless and tremulous, how many times</span><br/>

<span class="i0">The fatal firmness of the fool's resolve,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That looks like courage but is only fear.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They'll blunder on, and lose my ship, and drown;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or blunder home to England and be hanged.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Their skeletons will rattle in the chains</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of some tall gibbet on the Channel cliffs,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While passing mariners look up and say:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Those are the rotten bones of Hudson's men</span><br/>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O God of justice, why hast Thou ordained</span><br/>

<span class="i0">You Philip Staffe, the only one who chose</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Rather than travel in the hell-bound ship,—</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="294" id="page294"/>
<span class="i0">Too good an English sailor to desert</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Your crippled comrades,—try to make them rest</span><br/>
<span class="i0">More easy on the thwarts. And John, my son,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">My little shipmate, come and lean your head</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Against my knee. Do you remember still</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The April morn in Ethelburga's church,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Five years ago, when side by side we kneeled</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To take the sacrament with all our men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Before the <i>Hopewell</i> left St. Catherine's docks</span><br/>
<span class="i0">On our first voyage? It was then I vowed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">My sailor-soul and yours to search the sea</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Until we found the water-path that leads</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From Europe into Asia.</span><br/>
<span class="i12">                        I believe</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That God has poured the ocean round His world,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not to divide, but to unite the lands.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all the English captains that have dared</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In little ships to plough uncharted waves,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Davis and Drake, Hawkins and Frobisher,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Raleigh and Gilbert,—all the other names,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Are written in the chivalry of God</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As men who served His purpose. I would claim</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A place among that knighthood of the sea;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And I have earned it, though my quest should fail!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For, mark me well, the honour of our life</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Derives from this: to have a certain aim</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Before us always, which our will must seek</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Amid the peril of uncertain ways.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="295" id="page295"/>
<span class="i0">Then, though we miss the goal, our search is crowned</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With courage, and we find along our path</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A rich reward of unexpected things.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Press towards the aim: take fortune as it fares!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know not why, but something in my heart</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Has always whispered, “Westward seek your goal!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Three times they sent me east, but still I turned</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The bowsprit west, and felt among the floes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of ruttling ice along the Greenland coast,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And down the rugged shore of Newfoundland,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And past the rocky capes and wooded bays</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where Gosnold sailed,—like one who feels his way</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With outstretched hand across a darkened room,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I groped among the inlets and the isles,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To find the passage to the Land of Spice.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I have not found it yet,—but I have found</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Things worth the finding!</span><br/>
<span class="i13">                          Son, have you forgot</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Those mellow autumn days, two years ago,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When first we sent our little ship <i>Half-Moon</i>,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The flag of Holland floating at her peak,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Across a sandy bar, and sounded in</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Among the channels, to a goodly bay</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where all the navies of the world could ride?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A fertile island that the redmen called</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Manhattan, lay above the bay: the land</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Around was bountiful and friendly fair.</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="296" id="page296"/>
<span class="i0">But never land was fair enough to hold</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The seaman from the calling of the sea.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And so we bore to westward of the isle,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Along a mighty inlet, where the tide</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was troubled by a downward-flowing flood</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That seemed to come from far away,—perhaps</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From some mysterious gulf of Tartary?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Inland we held our course; by palisades</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of naked rock; by rolling hills adorned</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With forests rich in timber for great ships;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Through narrows where the mountains shut us in</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With frowning cliffs that seemed to bar the stream;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And then through open reaches where the banks</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sloped to the water gently, with their fields</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of corn and lentils smiling in the sun.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ten days we voyaged through that placid land,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Until we came to shoals, and sent a boat</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Upstream to find,—what I already knew,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We travelled on a river, not a strait.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But what a river! God has never poured</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A stream more royal through a land more rich.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Even now I see it flowing in my dream,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While coming ages people it with men</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of manhood equal to the river's pride.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I see the wigwams of the redmen changed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To ample houses, and the tiny plots</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of maize and green tobacco broadened out</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="297" id="page297"/>
<span class="i0">To prosperous farms, that spread o'er hill and dale</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The many-coloured mantle of their crops.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I see the terraced vineyard on the slope</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where now the fox-grape loops its tangled vine,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And cattle feeding where the red deer roam,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And wild-bees gathered into busy hives</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To store the silver comb with golden sweet;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And all the promised land begins to flow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With milk and honey. Stately manors rise</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Along the banks, and castles top the hills,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And little villages grow populous with trade,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Until the river runs as proudly as the Rhine,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The thread that links a hundred towns and towers!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Now looking deeper in my dream, I see</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A mighty city covering the isle</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They call Manhattan, equal in her state</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To all the older capitals of earth,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The gateway city of a golden world,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A city girt with masts, and crowned with spires,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And swarming with a million busy men,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While to her open door across the bay</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The ships of all the nations flock like doves.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">My name will be remembered there, the world</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Will say, “This river and this isle were found</span><br/>

<span class="i0">The Northwest Passage.”</span><br/>
<span class="i12">                        Yes, I seek it still,—</span><br/>

A DEMOCRATIC ODE <a href="#footnote1" class="pginternal"> * </a></h4>
<h4>I</h4>
<h4>THE WILD-BEES</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All along the Brazos river,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All along the Colorado,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the valleys and the lowlands</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where the trees were tall and stately,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the rich and rolling meadows</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where the grass was full of wild-flowers,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Came a humming and a buzzing,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Came the murmur of a going</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To and fro among the tree-tops,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Far and wide across the meadows.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the red-men in their tepees</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Smoked their pipes of clay and listened.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“What is this?” they asked in wonder;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Who can give the sound a meaning?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who can understand the language</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of this going in the tree-tops?”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then the wisest of the Tejas</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Laid his pipe aside and answered:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“O my brothers, these are people,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Very little, winged people,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="338" id="page338"/>
<span class="i0">Countless, busy, banded people,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Coming humming through the timber.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">These are tribes of bees, united</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By a single aim and purpose,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To possess the Tejas' country,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Gather harvest from the prairies,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Store their wealth among the timber.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">These are hive and honey makers,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Sent by Manito to warn us</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That the white men now are coming,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With their women and their children.</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Passing wildly in a moment,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like a flame across the prairies,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Dwelling in their haciendas,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Dreaming, talking of tomorrow,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">Change the rulers, not the people!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Other folk are these who follow</span><br/>
<span class="i0">When the wild-bees come to warn us;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">These are hive and honey makers,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">These are busy, banded people,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Roaming far to swarm and settle,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="339" id="page339"/>
<span class="i0">Working every day for harvest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Fighting hard for peace and order,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Worshipping as queens their women,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Making homes and building cities</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Full of riches and of trouble.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All our hunting-grounds must vanish,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All our lodges fall before them,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All our customs and traditions,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All our happy life of freedom,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Fade away like smoke before them.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Come, my brothers, strike your tepees,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Call your women, load your ponies!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Let us take the trail to westward,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where the plains are wide and open,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where the bison-herds are gathered</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Waiting for our feathered arrows.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We will live as lived our fathers,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Gleaners of the gifts of nature,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Hunters of the unkept cattle,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Men whose women run to serve them.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If the toiling bees pursue us,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If the white men seek to tame us,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We will fight them off and flee them,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Break their hives and take their honey,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Moving westward, ever westward,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">There to live as lived our fathers.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So the red-men drove their ponies,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With the tent-poles trailing after,</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="340" id="page340"/>
<span class="i0">Out along the path to sunset,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While along the river valleys</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Swarmed the wild-bees, the forerunners;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the white men, close behind them,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Men of mark from old Missouri,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Men of daring from Kentucky,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Tennessee, Louisiana,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Men of many States and races,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Bringing wives and children with them,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Followed up the wooded valleys,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Spread across the rolling prairies,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Raising homes and reaping harvests.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Rude the toil that tried their patience,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Fierce the fights that proved their courage,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Rough the stone and tough the timber</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Out of which they built their order!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Yet they never failed nor faltered,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the instinct of their swarming</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Made them one and kept them working,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Till their toil was crowned with triumph,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the country of the Tejas</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was the fertile land of Texas.</span></p>

THE RED FLOWER</h3>

<span class="i1">  Lay round me green and still.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But all day long on the eastern bank</span><br/>

<span class="i1">  Of trouble,—I knew not why.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came I into a certain field</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Where the devil's paint-brush spread</span><br/>
<span class="i0">'Mid the gray and green of the rolling hills</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  A flaring splotch of red,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">An evil omen, a bloody sign,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And a token of many dead.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I saw in a vision the field-gray horde</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Break forth at the devil's hour,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And trample the earth into crimson mud</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  In the rage of the Will to Power,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">All this I dreamed in the valley of Kyll,</span><br/>

THE GLORY OF SHIPS</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The glory of ships is an old, old song,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  since the days when the sea-rovers ran,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In their open boats through the roaring surf,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  and the spread of the world began;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The glory of ships is a light on the sea,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  and a star in the story of man.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Homer sang of the galleys of Greece</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  that conquered the Trojan shore,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And Solomon lauded the barks of Tyre</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  that brought great wealth to his door,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">'Twas little they knew, those ancient men,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  what would come of the sail and the oar.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Greek ships rescued the West from the East,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  when they harried the Persians home;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the Roman ships were the wings of strength</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  that bore up the empire, Rome;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the ships of Spain found a wide new world,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  far over the fields of foam.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="389" id="page389"/>
<span class="i0">Then the tribes of courage at last saw clear</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  that the ocean was not a bound,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But a broad highway, and a challenge to seek</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  for treasure as yet unfound;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So the fearless ships fared forth to the search,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  in joy that the globe was round.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their hulls were heightened, their sails spread out,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  they grew with the growth of their quest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They opened the secret doors of the East,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  and the golden gates of the West;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And many a city of high renown</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  was proud of a ship on its crest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fleets of England and Holland and France</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  were at strife with each other and Spain;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And battle and storm sent a myriad ships</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  to sleep in the depths of the main;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But the seafaring spirit could never be drowned,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  and it filled up the fleets again.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They greatened and grew, with the aid of steam,</span><br/>

<span class="i0">That carries the thoughts and the traffic of men</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  into every harbor and bay;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And now in the world-wide work of the ships</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  'tis England that leads the way.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="390" id="page390"/>
<span class="i0">O well for the leading that follows the law</span><br/>

<span class="i0">But ill for the leader who tries to hold</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  what belongs to mankind in fee!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The way of the ships is an open way,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  and the ocean must ever be free!</span></p>

<span class="i0">Remember, O first of the maritime folk,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  how the rise of your greatness began.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It will live if you safeguard the round-the-world road</span><br/>

LONGFELLOW</h3>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a great land, a new land, a land full of labour and riches and confusion,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where there were many running to and fro, and shouting, and striving together,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In the midst of the hurry and the troubled noise, I heard the voice of one singing.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“What are you doing there, O man, singing quietly amid all this tumult?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This is the time for new inventions, mighty shoutings, and blowings of the trumpet.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But he answered, “I am only shepherding my sheep with music.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he went along his chosen way, keeping his little flock around him;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And he paused to listen, now and then, beside the antique fountains,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Where the faces of forgotten gods were refreshed with musically falling waters;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or he sat for a while at the blacksmith's door, and heard the cling-clang of the anvils;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or he rested beneath old steeples full of bells, that showered their chimes upon him;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or he walked along the border of the sea, drinking in the long roar of the billows;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="435" id="page435"/>
<span class="i0">Or he sunned himself in the pine-scented shipyard, amid the tattoo of the mallets;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Or he leaned on the rail of the bridge, letting his thoughts flow with the whispering river;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He hearkened also to ancient tales, and made them young again with his singing.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a flaming arrow of death fell on his flock, and pierced the heart of his dearest!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Silent the music now, as the shepherd entered the mystical temple of sorrow:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Long he tarried in darkness there: but when he came out he was singing.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I saw the faces of men and women and children silently turning toward him;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The youth setting out on the journey of life, and the old man waiting beside the last mile-stone;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The toiler sweating beneath his load; and the happy mother rocking her cradle;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lonely sailor on far-off seas; and the gray-minded scholar in his book-room;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The mill-hand bound to a clacking machine; and the hunter in the forest;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And the solitary soul hiding friendless in the wilderness of the city;</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="436" id="page436"/>
<span class="i0">Many human faces, full of care and longing, were drawn irresistibly toward him,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">By the charm of something known to every heart, yet very strange and lovely,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And at the sound of his singing wonderfully all their faces were lightened.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Why do you listen, O you people, to this old and world-worn music?</span><br/>
<span class="i0">This is not for you, in the splendour of a new age, in the democratic triumph!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Listen to the clashing cymbals, the big drums, the brazen trumpets of your poets.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the people made no answer, following in their hearts the simpler music:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For it seemed to them, noise-weary, nothing could be better worth the hearing</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Than the melodies which brought sweet order into life's confusion.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the shepherd sang his way along, until he came unto a mountain:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And I know not surely whether the mountain was called Parnassus,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But he climbed it out of sight, and still I heard the voice of one singing.</span></p>

<span class="i1">  And major chords that glow with perfect peace,—</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Have fallen from above;</span><br/>

<span class="i1">  Then comes the adagio, with a yielding theme</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Through which the violas flow soft as in a dream,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      While horns and mild bassoons are heard</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      In tender tune, that seems to float</span><br/>

ACT I</h3>
<h4>Scene I</h4>
<p class="sd">
Night, in the garden of <em>Naaman</em> at Damascus. At the left
the palace, with softly gleaming lights and music coming
from the open latticed windows. The garden is full of
oleanders, roses, pomegranates, abundance of crimson
flowers; the air is heavy with their fragrance: a fountain
at the right is plashing gently: behind it is an arbour
covered with vines. Near the centre of the garden stands
a small, hideous image of the god Rimmon. Beyond
the arbour rises the lofty square tower of the House of
Rimmon, which casts a shadow from the moon across the
garden. The background is a wide, hilly landscape, with
the snow-clad summit of Mount Herman in the distance.
Enter by the palace door, the lady <em>Tsarpi</em>, robed in red
and gold, and followed by her maids, <em>Khamma</em> and <em>Nubta</em>.
She remains on the terrace: they go down into the garden,
looking about, and returning to her.</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="speaker"><em>Khamma:</em></span><br/>
<span class="i0">There's no one here; the garden is asleep.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="speaker"><em>Nubta:</em></span><br/>
<span class="i0">The flowers are nodding, all the birds abed,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Nothing awake except the watchful stars!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="speaker"><em>Khamma:</em></span><br/>
<span class="i0">The stars are sentinels discreet and mute:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">How many things they know and never tell!</span></p>

<a class="pagebreak" title="476" id="page476"/>
<span class="speaker"><em>Tsarpi:</em> <strong>[</strong>Impatiently.<strong>]</strong></span><br/>
<span class="i0">Unlike the stars, how many things you tell</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And do not know! When comes your master home?</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="speaker"><em>Nubta:</em></span><br/>
<span class="i0">Lady, his armour-bearer brought us word,—</span><br/>

<span class="speaker"><em>Tsarpi:</em></span><br/>

<span class="i0">An hour of moonlight yet! Khamma, my mirror!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">These curls are ill arranged, this veil too low,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">So,—that is better, careless maids! Withdraw,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But bring me word if Naaman appears!</span></p>

from the shadow of the trees. He stands behind <em>Tsarpi</em>

<h4>Scene II</h4>
<p class="central"><span class="sc">Time:</span> <i>Three days later</i></p>
<p class="sd">
Inner court of the House of Rimmon; a temple with huge
pillars at each side. In the right foreground the seat of
the King; at the left, of equal height, the seat of the High
Priest. In the background a broad flight of steps, rising
to a curtain of cloudy gray, embroidered with two gigantic
hands holding thunderbolts. The temple is in half
darkness at first. Enter <em>Khamma</em> and <em>Nubta</em>, robed as
Kharimati, or religious dancers, in gowns of black gauze
with yellow embroideries and mantles.</p>

<span class="prose">How can he come back? The Hebrew slave that
went away with him, when they caught her, said
that he was dead. The High Priest has shut her
up in the prison of the temple, accusing her of
her master's death.</span></p>

THE LITTLE-NECK CLAM</h3>
<p class="note">
A modern verse-sequence, showing how a native American subject,
strictly realistic, may be treated in various manners adapted to the
requirements of different magazines, thus combining Art-for-Art's-Sake
with Writing-for-the-Market. Read at the First Dinner of the
American Periodical Publishers' Association, in Washington, April,
1904.
</p>
<h4>I</h4>
<h4>THE ANTI-TRUST CLAM</h4>
<h4>For <i>McClure's Magazine</i></h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The clam that once, on Jersey's banks,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Was like the man who dug it, free,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Now slave-like thro' the market clanks</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In chains of corporate tyranny.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Standard Fish-Trust of New York</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Holds every clam-bank in control;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And like base Beef and menial Pork,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The free-born Clam has lost its soul.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No more the bivalve treads the sands</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In freedom's rapture, free from guilt:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It follows now the harsh commands</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of Morgiman and Rockabilt.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rise, freemen, rise! Your wrath is just!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Call on the Sherman Act to dam</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The floods of this devouring Trust,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And liberate the fettered Clam.</span></p>

<h4>THE WHITMANIAC CLAM</h4>
<h4>For the <i>Bookman</i></h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not Dante when he wandered by the river Arno,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not Burns who plowed the banks and braes of bonnie Ayr,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not even Shakspere on the shores of Avon,—ah, no!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Not one of those great bards did taste true Poet's Fare.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Whitman, loafing in Long Island and New Jersey,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Found there the sustenance of mighty ode and psalm,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And while his rude emotions swam around in verse, he</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Fed chiefly on the wild, impassioned, sea-born clam.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus in his work we feel the waves' bewildering motion,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And winds from mighty mud-flats, weird and wild:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">His clam-filled bosom answered to the voice of ocean,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And rose and fell responsively with every tide.</span></p>

<h4>For the <i>Century Magazine</i></h4>

<span class="i0">“Clam O! Fres' Clam!” How strange it sounds and sweet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Dago's cry along the New York street!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“Dago” we call him, like the thoughtless crowd;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And yet this humble man may well be proud</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To hail from Petrarch's land, Boccaccio's home,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Firenze, Gubbio, Venezia, Rome,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">From fair Italia, whose enchanted soil</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Transforms the lowly cotton-seed to olive-oil.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To me his chant, with alien accent sung,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Brings back an echo of great Virgil's tongue:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">It seems to cry against the city's woe,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In liquid Latin syllables,—<i>Clamo</i>!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">As thro' the crowded street his cart he jams</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And cries aloud, ah, think of more than clams!</span><br/>

A FAIRY TALE</h3>
<h4>For the Mark Twain Dinner, December 5, 1905</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i1">  Some three-score years and ten ago</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  A prince was born at Florida, Mo.;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And though he came <i>incognito</i>,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With just the usual yells of woe,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The watchful fairies seemed to know</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Precisely what the row meant;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  For when he was but five days old,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  (December fifth as I've been told,)</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  They pattered through the midnight cold,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And came around his crib, to hold</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        A “Council of Endowment.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i1">  “I give him Wit,” the eldest said,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And stooped above the little bed,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To touch his forehead round and red.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  “Within this bald, unfurnished head,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Where wild luxuriant locks shall spread</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And wave in years hereafter,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  I kindle now the lively spark,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  That still shall flash by day and dark,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And everywhere he goes shall mark</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        His way with light and laughter.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="556" id="page556"/>
<span class="i1">  The fairies laughed to think of it</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  That such a rosy, wrinkled bit</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Of flesh should be endowed with Wit!</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  But something serious seemed to hit</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The mind of one, as if a fit</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Of fear had come upon her.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  “I give him Truth,” she quickly cried,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  “That laughter may not lead aside</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  To paths where scorn and falsehood hide,—</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        I give him Truth and Honour!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i1">  “I give him Love,” exclaimed the third;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And as she breathed the mystic word,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  I know not if the baby heard,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  But softly in his dream he stirred,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And twittered like a little bird,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And stretched his hands above him.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  The fairy's gift was sealed and signed</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With kisses twain the deed to bind:</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  “A heart of love to human-kind,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And human-kind to love him!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="557" id="page557"/>
<span class="i1">  “Now stay your giving!” cried the Queen.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  “These gifts are passing rich I ween;</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  And if reporters should be mean</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Enough to spy upon this scene,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  'Twould make all other babies green</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        With envy at the rumour.</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  Yet since I love this child, forsooth,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  I'll mix your gifts, Wit, Love and Truth,</span><br/>
<span class="i1">  With spirits of Immortal Youth,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And call the mixture Humour!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fairies vanished with their glittering train;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But here's the Prince with all their gifts,—<i>Mark Twain</i>.</span></p>

THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS</h3>
<h4>Recited at the Century Club, New York: Twelfth Night. 1906</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come all ye good Centurions and wise men of the times,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">You've made a Poet Laureate, now you must hear his rhymes.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Extend your ears and I'll respond by shortening up my tale:—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Man cannot live by verse alone, he must have cakes and ale.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So while you wait for better things and muse on schnapps and salad,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I'll try my Pegasus his wings and sing a little ballad:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A legend of your ancestors, the Wise Men of the East,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who brought among their baggage train a quaint and curious beast.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their horses were both swift and strong, and we should think it lucky</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If we could buy, by telephone, such horses from Kentucky;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Their dromedaries paced along, magnificent and large,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Their camels were as stately as if painted by La Farge.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But this amazing little ass was never satisfied,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He made more trouble every day than all the rest beside:</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="559" id="page559"/>
<span class="i0">His ears were long, his legs were short, his eyes were bleared and dim,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But nothing in the wide, wide world was good enough for him.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He did not like the way they went, but lifted up his voice</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And said that any other way would be a better choice.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He braced his feet and stood his ground, and made the wise men wait,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">While with his heels at all around he did recalcitrate.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It mattered not how fair the land through which the road might run,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He found new causes for complaint with every Morning Sun:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And when the shades of twilight fell and all the world grew nappy,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They tied him to his Evening Post, but still he was not happy.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He thought his load was far too large, he thought his food was bad,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He thought the Star a poor affair, he thought the Wise Men mad:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He did not like to hear them laugh,—'twas childish to be jolly;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And if perchance they sang a hymn,—'twas sentimental folly!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="560" id="page560"/>
<span class="i0">So day by day this little beast performed his level best</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To make their life, in work and play, a burden to the rest:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And when they laid them down at night, he would not let them sleep,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But criticized the Universe with hee-haws loud and deep.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One evening, as the Wise Men sat before their fire-lit tent,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And ate and drank and talked and sang, in grateful merriment,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The solemn donkey butted in, in his most solemn way,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And broke the happy meeting up with a portentous bray.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now by my head,” Balthazar said (his real name was Choate),</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“We've had about enough of this! I'll put it to the vote.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I move the donkey be dismissed; let's turn him out to grass,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And travel on our cheerful way, without the solemn ass.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The vote was aye! and with a whack the Wise Men drove him out;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But still he wanders up and down, and all the world about;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">You'll know him by his long, sad face and supercilious ways,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And likewise by his morning kicks and by his evening brays.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="561" id="page561"/>
<span class="i0">But while we sit at Eagle Roost and make our Twelfth Night cheer,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Full well we know the solemn ass will not disturb us here:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">For pleasure rules the roost to-night, by order of the King,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And every one must play his part, and laugh, and likewise sing.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The road of life is long, we know, and often hard to find,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And yet there's many a pleasant turn for men of cheerful mind:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We've done our day's work honestly, we've earned the right to rest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">We'll take a cup of friendship now and spice it with a jest.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A silent health to absent friends, their memories are bright!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A hearty health to all who keep the feast with us to-night!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A health to dear Centuria, oh, may she long abide!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">A health, a health to all the world,—and the solemn ass, <i>outside</i>!</span></p>

A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS</h3>
<h4>For the St. Nicholas Society of New York</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Among the earliest saints of old, before the first Hegira,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">I find the one whose name we hold, St. Nicholas of Myra:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The best-beloved name, I guess, in sacred nomenclature,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The patron-saint of helpfulness, and friendship, and good-nature.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A bishop and a preacher too, a famous theologian,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He stood against the Arian crew and fought them like a Trojan:</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But when a poor man told his need and begged an alms in trouble,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He never asked about his creed, but quickly gave him double.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three pretty maidens, so they say, were longing to be married;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But they were paupers, lack-a-day, and so the suitors tarried.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">St. Nicholas gave each maid a purse of golden ducats chinking,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And then, for better or for worse, they wedded quick as winking.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="563" id="page563"/>
<span class="i0">Once, as he sailed, a storm arose; wild waves the ship surrounded;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The sailors wept and tore their clothes, and shrieked “We'll all be drownded!”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">St. Nicholas never turned a hair; serenely shone his halo;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">He simply said a little prayer, and all the billows lay low.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wicked keeper of an inn had three small urchins taken,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And cut them up in a pickle-bin, and salted them for bacon.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">St. Nicholas came and picked them out, and put their limbs together,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">They lived, they leaped, they gave a shout, “St. Nicholas forever!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus it came to pass, you know, that maids without a nickel,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And sailor-lads when tempest blow, and children in a pickle,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And every man that's fatherly, and every kindly matron,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In choosing saints would all agree to call St. Nicholas patron.</span></p>

ARS AGRICOLARIS</h3>
<h4>An Ode for the “Farmer's Dinner,” University Club, New York,
January 23, 1913</h4>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All hail, ye famous Farmers!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ye vegetable-charmers,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Who know the art of making barren earth</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Smile with prolific mirth</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And bring forth twins or triplets at a birth!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ye scientific <ins title="Original read 'fetilizers'">fertilizers</ins> of the soil,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And horny-handed sons of toil!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">To-night from all your arduous cares released,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With manly brows no longer sweat-impearled,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ye hold your annual feast,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And like the Concord farmers long ago,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Ye meet above the “Bridge” below,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And draw the cork heard round the world!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What memories are yours! What tales</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of triumph have your tongues rehearsed,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Telling how ye have won your first</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Potatoes from the stubborn mead,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">(Almost as many as ye sowed for seed!)</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And how the luscious cabbages and kails</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Have bloomed before you in their bed</span><br/>
<span class="i0">At seven dollars a head!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And how your onions took a prize</span><br/>
<a class="pagebreak" title="566" id="page566"/>
<span class="i0">For bringing tears into the eyes</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of a hard-hearted cook! And how ye slew</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The Dragon Cut-worm at a stroke!</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      And how ye broke,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Routed, and put to flight the horrid crew</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of vile potato-bugs and Hessian flies!</span><br/>
<span class="i2">     And how ye did not quail</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Before th' invading armies of San José Scale,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    But met them bravely with your little pail</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Of poison, which ye put upon each tail</span><br/>
<span class="i0">O' the dreadful beasts and made their courage fail!</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      And how ye did acquit yourselves like men</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      In fields of agricultural strife, and then,</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Like generous warriors, sat you down at ease</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      And gently to your gardener said, “Let us have <i>Pease</i>!”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But <i>were</i> there Pease? Ah, no, dear Farmers, no!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The course of Nature is not ordered so.</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    For when we want a vegetable most,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        She holds it back;</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And when we boast</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    To our week-endly friends</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Of what we'll give them on our farm, alack,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Those things the old dam, Nature, never sends.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="567" id="page567"/>
<span class="i0">O Pease in bottles, Sparrow-grass in jars,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">How often have ye saved from scars</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of shame, and deep embarrassment,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">The disingenuous farmer-gent,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    To whom some wondering guest has cried,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    “How <i>do</i> you raise such Pease and Sparrow-grass?”</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Whereat the farmer-gent has not denied</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The compliment, but smiling has replied,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    “To raise such things you must have lots of glass.”</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From wiles like these, true Farmers, hold aloof;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Accept no praise unless you have the proof.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If niggard Nature should withhold the green</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And sugary Pea, welcome the humble Bean.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Even the easy Radish, and the Beet,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">If grown by your own toil are extra sweet.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Let malefactors of great wealth and banker-felons</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Rejoice in foreign artichokes, imported melons;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">But you, my Farmers, at your frugal board</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Spread forth the fare your Sabine Farms afford.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Say to Mæcenas, when he is your guest,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“No peaches! try this turnip, 'tis my best.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Thus shall ye learn from labors in the field</span><br/>
<span class="i0">What honesty a farmer's life may yield,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And like G. Washington in early youth,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Though cherries fail, produce a crop of truth.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="568" id="page568"/>
<span class="i0">But think me not too strict, O followers of the plough;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Some place for fiction in your lives I would allow.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">In January when the world is drear,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And bills come in, and no results appear,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And snow-storms veil the skies,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And ice the streamlet clogs,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Then may you warm your heart with pleasant lies</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And revel in the seedsmen's catalogues!</span><br/>
<span class="i0">What visions and what dreams are these</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Of cauliflower obese,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Of giant celery, taller than a mast,—</span><br/>
<span class="i3">      Of strawberries</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Like red pincushions, round and vast,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Of succulent and spicy gumbo,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Of cantaloupes, as big as Jumbo,—</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    Of high-strung beans without the strings,—</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And of a host of other wild, romantic things!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">    Why, then, should Doctor Starr declare</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That modern habits mental force impair?</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And why should H. Marquand complain</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That jokes as good as his will never come again?</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    And why should Bridges wear a gloomy mien</span><br/>
<span class="i0">About the lack of fiction for his Magazine?</span><br/>
<span class="i2">    The seedsman's catalogue is all we need</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        To stir our dull imaginations</span><br/>
<span class="i5">          To new creations,</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        And lead us, by the hand</span><br/>
<span class="i4">        Of Hope, into a fairy-land.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
<a class="pagebreak" title="569" id="page569"/>
<span class="i0">So dream, my friendly Farmers, as you will;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And let your fancy all your garners fill</span><br/>
<span class="i0">With wondrous crops; but always recollect</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That Nature gives us less than we expect.</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Scorn not the city where you earn the wealth</span><br/>
<span class="i0">That, spent upon your farms, renews your health;</span><br/>
<span class="i0">And tell your wife, whene'er the bills have shocked her,</span><br/>
<span class="i0">“A country-place is cheaper than a doctor.”</span><br/>
<span class="i0">May roses bloom for you, and may you find</span><br/>
<span class="i0">Your richest harvest in a tranquil mind.</span></p>

<span class="i0">Oh, the angler plays for the pleasure of the game,</span><br/>
